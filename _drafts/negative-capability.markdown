Negative capability is a concept by poet John Keats the describes "the ability to contemplate the world without the desire to try and reconcile contradictory aspects" of it.[^keatskingdom]

It's a positive twist on conflict. A way of adjusting your approach to the world so it's not negative but instead understanding that not much will fall into your idea of the perfect system (whatever that system may be).

Keats was referring mostly to creating literature and poetry when he coined this concept but the idea is applicable across other spaces: religion and politics come to mind immediately!

The ability to see your world and accept the contradictions is required in religion. It's called faith. 

But at the same time, it is what drives open-mindedness
