For several years after graduate school I stopped reading books. The pace of reading in school was so intense that I grew to hate reading.

For years afterward my stomach would sink when I opened a book to read it. I'd feel a heavy weight on me. It didn't matter if this was a book I was reading out of pure pleasure, I couldn't fight off the feeling.

It took a long time to conquer and sequester that feeling. Now, more than 10 years after finishing graduate school, I am fully enjoying reading again. And just not pleasure reads, but harder stuff, too.

My goal in 2016 is to read 100 books (I'm a little behind as I write this). 

I'm not entirely fixated on the number but need to have the goal--and system--in order to stay motivated. Let's be honest: it's easier to be busy with an electronic device than it is to quietly sit and read a good book.

This page is a list of the books I've read and links to reviews, if I've written one for the book.
