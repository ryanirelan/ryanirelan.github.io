[David Weinberger](http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/2014/11/07/the-blogosphere-lives/) on the quiet re-emergence of blogging:

> Blogs are — or at least were — different. They are an individual’s place for speaking out loud, but the relationships that form around them were based on links among posts, not social networks that link among people. I’m all for social networks, but we also need networks of ideas.
