I was cruising along, reading this review of  the Hemingway 2 app and all was good until I got to this at the end:

This is one of my least favorite sentiments among developers. 

It might drive us to do better but is also so easily thrown out as a cheap insult that is _usually_ ignorant of the actual work behind a tool or technology.
