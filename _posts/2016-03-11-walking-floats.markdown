I like to think that floats are the dirty little secret of web developers everywhere: we know enough about them to use them but we all secretly fear them. We fear them in a way that maybe they’ll come to life one day and hunt us down, like zombies looking to expand their fleet of walking dead. We furiously type `clear:both;` anywhere we can find space _but nothing happens_. They’re still chasing us.
