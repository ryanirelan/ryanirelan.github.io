A couple of years ago I came across a framed photo of my father. It was sitting on the dresser in my parents bedroom. I took it out of the frame and scanned it into my laptop so I had a copy.

To people who know me or have met me this photo could easily be a [Hipstamatic](http://hipstamaticapp.com/) or [Instagram](http://instagr.am/) shot of me from yesterday. And, oddly, until I saw this photo I never realized how much I look like my dad.
