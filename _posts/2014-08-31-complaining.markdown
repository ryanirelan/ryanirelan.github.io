David Allen:

> Complaining is a sign that someone isn't willing to risk moving on a changeable situation, or won't consider the immutable circumstance in his or her plans. This is temporary and hollow form of self-validation.

Taken from his book _[Getting Things Done](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142000280/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0142000280&linkCode=as2&tag=ryanirelan-20&linkId=J7TPZ7RNNYVCES72)_.
