I'm not sure what happened with index cards. Most of the cards you can buy now are _not_ cut from card stock but instead a heavyweight paper stock.[^notapaperexpert]

You do not want those. [You want these. Oxford 3x5 Heavy weight index card ](http://www.staples.com/Oxford-3-inch-x-5-inch-Heavy-Weight-Lined-Ruled-White-Index-Cards-100/product_71737) (I'll leave lined or unlined up to you--I prefer lined). 

My local office supply didn't have them the last time I ordered, so I used Amazon. I just looked and even Amazon isn't carrying them (third party sellers were but I don't use them because they're price gougers). You might want to stock up.

An alternative is the excellent looking [DotDash notecard by Nock Co.](http://nockco.com/paper/dotdash-3-x-5-note-cards) They are quite a bit more expensive but you will get quality.

My video on how I create courses for [Mijingo](https://mijingo.com) explains how I use notecards:

[^notapaperexpert]: I'm not a paper expert so if I'm confusing the terms "card stock" and "heavy weight paper" please correct me. Let's just one is too thin and the other is a proper index card, deal?
