_To hone your writing, hire a translator_:

This reminds me a talk [Jeffrey Zeldman](http://zeldman.com) gave in 2006 at  An Event Apart. I can’t remember the name of the talk (or find a video), but the gist of it was:  labor over your sentences and leave in only the words that bring actual meaning. No filler words allowed. I think about is talk every time I write anything that isn’t just my private notes.
