What I love about [Steven Pressfield's The War of Art](http://www.stevenpressfield.com/the-war-of-art/) is that he preemptively calls out the people who over-glorify his own book:

>  The professional is acutely aware of the intangibles that go into inspiration. Out of respect for them, she lets them work. She grants them their sphere while she concentrates on hers.

> The sign of the amateur is overglorification of and preccopuation with the mystery.

> The professional shuts up. She doesn't talk about it. She does her work.

[_The War of Art, p. 78_](https://books.google.com/books?id=sR3hAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78&dq=She+grants+them+their+sphere+while+she+concentrates+on+hers.&source=bl&ots=L3anoAwlnT&sig=_yipUybC_-ChfhbV-DHwQW1dvvM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=6sjrVNW_MZL7yAS764GYDg&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=She%20grants%20them%20their%20sphere%20while%20she%20concentrates%20on%20hers.&f=false)

He calls out everyone who is on some quest to solve the mystery of getting things done, producing work or shipping. He calls out _the entire_ cottage industry of you-can-do-its. And, yet, the book is one the canonical texts used to support it.
