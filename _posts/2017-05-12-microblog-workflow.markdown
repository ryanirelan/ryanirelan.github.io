My old friend and former colleague Manton Reece created [a microblogging platform](https://micro.blog/about) with the mission of creating an independent social network of microblogs.

What's a microblog?

It's a collection of short messages or "quick thoughts, links to web sites, and replies to friends" that you post to your own site or via the Micro.blog website (they'll host one for you).

Your microblog posts can be x-posted to Twitter as tweets, too. 

Here's my workflow: I post very short updates to this site that are shorter than both a link post or full article. These are x-posted to Twitter as tweets but the actual content is sourced from my own site, which I fully control. The updates also get fed into the Micro.blog service so I can participate in those social circles.

This is a bit of a shift in thinking but it is nice to keep my important updates (Twitter replies don't count) included in my own content archive.

When I moved this site to Jekyll almost six years ago, [I shared that I was interested in a future-proof way to keep my content](http://ryanirelan.com/2011/07/30/navel-gazing.html):

> This Spring I moved the site to Jekyll, which isn’t really a CMS at all. It’s a Ruby tool that generates a static website from a series of text files for entries and layout files. Every time I write a new entry (like this one) the site is completely regenerated. Movable Type did this, too, but Jekyll doesn’t have a GUI, isn’t a web application (you run it completely on your local machine), is free and surely won’t be sold to some weird advertising company. Also, Jekyll generates my site from Markdown files, which are just text files and will never fall victim to obsolete software. Sounds like a winner to me.

Markdown plain text files? Yes, please.

Sourcing my updates from this site and then feeding them out to different services is in keeping with the original idea that my writing is in (mostly?) future-proof text files and won't fall victim to sunset services or software.

Micro.blog is still in Kickstarter beta but you can [sign up to be notified](https://micro.blog/) when it launches to the general public.
