A system for smartly passing small but effective amounts of money on to future generations.

> It keeps accounts from lasting for generations: The longer an individual account lasts, the more complicated it will become and the more likely it will be subject to taxes and possible seizure.

> It keeps the giving in a tight family group.  After my grandchildren I am not contributing any more money.  Every gift of money comes from the parents or the grandparents. These are people who the heirs know and can relate to.

If this is something you choose to do, here's how you do it.

I know this is probably a controversial approach to money management but, if anything, it's one rooted in _spending less than you earn_, _saving_, and _investing what you save_. Those are some good habits.
