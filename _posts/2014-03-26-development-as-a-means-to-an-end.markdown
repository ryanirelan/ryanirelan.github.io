title: Tech as a Means to an End

[Jon Yongfook](http://yongfook.com/10-reasons-why-i-self-funded-my-startup-and-so-should-you.html) in an article about bootstrapping his SaaS business.

> I'm a programmer. But I hate conversations about what "stack" I'm using. I love programming because it is a means to an end - creating a product that customers love. I'm not the kind of tech guy who experiments with new stuff for the sake of it. I view tech through the lens of customer benefits - can a piece of technology improve customer experience somehow (e.g. make the app run faster etc)? If so, great - I'll check it out. If no, but it's whizzy and new - I'll pass thanks.

This isn't just a problem in the programming/development world but we can definitely miss the product for the tools quite often.
