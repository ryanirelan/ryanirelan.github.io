The for-profit university has lost half of its students. For-profit education companies are responsible for half the student loan defaults. _Half_.

It's still hard to get a good job--and stay employed--without a college education ([the stats don't lie](http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_chart_001.htm)) but saddling yourself with tens of thousands of debt isn't the answer.

There are better ways to learn, especially higher paying, higher growth jobs in web design and web development.
