The focus is back on their Safari subscription service instead of one-off sales. I did notice they pushed a lot of deep discounts on the ebooks. It had to be a losing venture when you factor in the per transaction cost. At scale in a broader market, which Oâ€™Reilly definitely is, subscription is the only way to go.
