Today I ran my first 10k race (and my first race). The entire race I listened to part of the [Launch. A Startup Documentary](http://www.startupstoriespodcast.com/podcast/the-complete-saga/) podcast. It's the story of building and launching [Drip](http://getdrip.com), a bootstrapped lead generation/conversion email marketing tool by Rob Walling and team. 

All through my 3x weekly training runs for the last 10 weeks, I listened to podcasts or audiobooks while I ran. I found they soothed me and helped distract me early on when the running was particularly hard.
