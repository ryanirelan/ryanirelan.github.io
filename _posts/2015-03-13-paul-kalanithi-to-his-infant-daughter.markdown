Dr. Paul Kalanithi to his infant daughter:

> When you come to one of the many moments in life when you must give an account of yourself, provide a ledger of what you have been, and done, and meant to the world, do not, I pray, discount that you filled a dying manâ€™s days with a sated joy, a joy unknown to me in all my prior years, a joy that does not hunger for more and more, but rests, satisfied. In this time, right now, that is an enormous thing.

Paul was a Stanford neurosurgeon that died on March 9, 2015 of non-small-cell EGFR-positive lung cancer. He was 37, his daughter is 8 months old. 

He also wrote about being a doctor and patient [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/25/opinion/sunday/how-long-have-i-got-left.html?_r=0) and [here](http://stanmed.stanford.edu/2015spring/before-i-go.html).
