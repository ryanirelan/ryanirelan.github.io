> While we were scouting for farmers in the community of Biloya in southern Ethiopia to start a small-grower project to produce high-quality natural sundried coffees, we came across growers in an adjacent community called Hama. In this community, we met Birhanu Zerihun who built an impressive set-up for his natural sundried coffees on his 10 hectares of landâ€”and created a super-juicy coffee with bright notes raspberry and strawberry. 

I received a bag of this for Christmas from my wife and daughter and it is delicious. I partial to bright coffee and this is delicious.
