From the Comma Queen at the New Yorker:

> The serial comma, also known as the Oxford comma, is the one before “and” in a series of three or more: Herman Melville wrote “Moby-Dick,” “Billy Budd,” and “Bartleby, the Scrivener.”
> 
> It is also the improbable subject of a passionate debate among scholars, journalists, and copy editors. Can’t we all just get along?

Me? I use the serial comma because it creates clarity. Everything from the Comma Queen is worth your time. I have [her book](http://www.worldcat.org/title/between-you-me-confessions-of-a-comma-queen/oclc/897468521&referer=brief_results) on hold at the library.
