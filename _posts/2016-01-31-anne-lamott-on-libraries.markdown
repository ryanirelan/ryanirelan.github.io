Anne Lamott ([via Brain Pickings](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/04/09/the-public-library-robert-dawson-book/))

> A free public library is a revolutionary notion, and when people don’t have free access to books, then communities are like radios without batteries. You cut people off from essential sources of information — mythical, practical, linguistic, political — and you break them. You render them helpless in the face of political oppression.
