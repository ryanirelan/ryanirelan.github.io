I've been on the hunt for a nice Mac app that will let me handle thousands of text file notes in different directories. I have been using nvALT for _years_ but out-of-the-box it only handles a single directory. I've needed to organize my plain text files in subfolders to help me organize them by area of my life. 

I'm giving [Write](http://writeapp.net/) a go. 

One thing I already miss about nvALT is effortlessly navigating the entire thing with my keyboard. Write isn't so well-tuned.
