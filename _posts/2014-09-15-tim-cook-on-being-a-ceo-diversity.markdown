[Apple CEO Tim Cook in his recent Charlie Rose interview](http://9to5mac.com/2014/09/13/part-one-of-charlie-roses-full-interview-with-tim-cook-now-available-online/):

> If you're a CEO, the most important thing is to pick people around you that aren't like you--that compliment you--because you want to build a puzzle; you don't want to stack chiclets up and have everyone be the same. I believe in diversity with a capital D. And that's diversity in thought.
