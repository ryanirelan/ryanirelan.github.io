Learning how to run gave me the patience, focus, and individuality to better run my own business. Much like running, managing my video training company is an individual sport where all that matter are my own goals and progress. 

This was an important lesson.

This past January I sat in the chair in our master bedroom and signed up for two things: a 0-10k training class, and the Cap 10K Race here in Austin. Both were big challenges for me because I've always considered myself "not a runner."

I started researching everything I could find out about running; the best running gear, _how fast I should run_, and tips for new runners. As I researched, I also found that running is very personal. All tips were couched in "this might be different for you" and stressed that every runner is different. Listen to your body. Only you know yourself the best.

Other than making sure you properly warm up, and maybe even wear suitable clothing (although I suppose that's debatable but I've found high quality running gear to be essential), everything else is subjective.

* Your training plan is tailored to your fitness level, experience, and goals.
* Your pace (miles or kilometers per minute) is your own. Some people run faster, some slower. I happen to be a fairly slow runner.
* Your race goals are your own. Do you have the goal to complete the race or to set a personal record?

This is so much different than how much of the startup world works right now. Especially the startup world of businesses that operate online.

A big trend is to share your experience and results and then establish that as fact. This one thing worked for me once, so you should do it, too.

Another trend, mostly among internet marketing and information products types, is to publish monthly income reports, which detail the entirety of the business's financials. This induces--whether intentional or not--a comparison that your business should be like that one.

One thing you'll observe in the running culture is that comparing times, pace, and goals is not only uncommon, but also considered silly. Why would my nearly 40 year-old body--with all of its different experiences, age, and limitations--do the same exact running times as your 20 year old body?

Why would my indie 5 year-old business make the same decisions as your funded, 100-person business?

It's ludicrous and a damn good way to hurt yourself.

And your business.
