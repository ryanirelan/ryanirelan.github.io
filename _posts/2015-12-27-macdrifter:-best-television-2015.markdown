I haven't see any of these shows yet. I started episode 1 of Daredevil but abandoned it because I decided to spend that time on other stuff.

My biggest problem with television watching is that I have a hard time sitting still for that long and feeling good about investing my time in sitting and watching something. 

This comes from my years as a full-time employee with a side business and always feeling like I had to crank away on the side business widgets during any downtime. This changed a bit after becoming a father but you just shift things around to make room for work anyway. 

For 2016, I am going to try to work a bit more pleasure entertainment (fiction reading and watching) into my schedule.
