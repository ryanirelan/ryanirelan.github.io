The first story in [Richard Feynman's fine collection of personal stories](http://www.amazon.com/Surely-Feynman-Adventures-Curious-Character/dp/0393316041) is about his work as a boy fixing radios. Early on, Feynman learned that he was much more successful when he stopped and thought before approaching a problem.

He was fixing a radio for a man who didn't understand this.

> So the guy says, "What are you doing? You come to fix the radio, but you're only walking back and forth!"

> I say, "I'm thinking!"

After fixing the man's radio, Feynman got some referral work.

> He got me other jobs, and kept telling everybody what a tremendous genius I was, saying, "He fixes radios by _thinking_!"
