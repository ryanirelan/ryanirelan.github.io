A couple months ago I purchased a [Tom Bihn Synapse 25](https://www.tombihn.com/collections/backpacks/products/synapse-25?variant=19611983431). Google the name; itâ€™s a popular backpack. There are a lot of reviews out there. 

What follows in the video is my walk-thru of the bag and how I use it (along with some Tom Bihn accessories).
