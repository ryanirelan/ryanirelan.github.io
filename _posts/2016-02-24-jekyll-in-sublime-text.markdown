The [previous update](http://ryanirelan.com/2016/02/23/recording-a-new-lesson.html) was about creating a Mijingo lesson on [Jekyll and Sublime Text](https://mijingo.com/lessons/jekyll-in-sublime-text/). That lesson is now live.

I walk through how to use the sublime-jekyll package for Sublime Text. I'm using it to publish this link post.
