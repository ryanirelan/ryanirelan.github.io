title: Block Political Sites with Hosts File
date: April 16, 2012

We are all capable of and successful at doing things we know are bad for us. Excessive drinking and eating, smoking, not exercising, and *reading too many political blogs*.

The silly season of politics seems to be year-round in the USA now so I've had to take some drastic measures to _force myself_ to break a couple of habits that aren't healthy.

The magic of your `/etc/hosts` file on your Mac. Point the domains at your localhost (127.0.0.1) and now every time you go to the site it won't be there for you to read.
