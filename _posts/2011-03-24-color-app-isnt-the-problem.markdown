It&rsquo;s just part of it. The real problem is the increased public sharing of photos online. I don&rsquo;t mean the photos I willingly share of my daughter on Twitter, Flickr or Facebook. I&rsquo;m talking about the photos of people at public (or private) events plastered all over social networks without their permission.

This year I didn&rsquo;t attend SXSW but instead observed it from the outside through Twitter, Flickr and Facebook. I was struck by how many personal moments were recorded and shared on social sites. How many of those people in the photos knew that was going to happen?
