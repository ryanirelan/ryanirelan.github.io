I'm moving most of my projects to Gitlab. I still like Github (this site is hosted there) and I'm still a customer. However, Gitlab is a longer term choice for me because their model is much more sustainable. I'm looking more and more to bring my tools in-house. Gitlab lets me do that by hosting my own repositories with their excellent software.
