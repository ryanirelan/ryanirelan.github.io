For the last year I've been using the [Infinity Wallet](http://amzn.to/2gazHa1)[^1] as my every day wallet. I'm not a regular cash carrier so I use this wallet almost exclusviely for cards. It will stretch to fit as many cards as you need and then snap back when you downsize. 

The Infinity Wallet has two slots on each side to hold cards and a middle area (that is open on both ends) to easily slide in cash. The tension from the wallet and cards keeps whatever is in the middle space secure. I like to use this middle space for temoporary items, like parking tickets or hotel room key cards.
