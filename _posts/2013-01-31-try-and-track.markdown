![The bookmarks folder in Chrome that holds my beta sites](/img/beta-chrome-holder.png)

I like to try a lot of stuff. New services, web apps, and even content sites. But I am terrible at keeping up with what I'm trying. So I started putting them all into a "beta" bookmarks folder in Chrome.

The services themselves aren't in beta (although some may be). They're just in beta in my workflow and can be deleted or abandoned at any time if I don't find the service or website useful to my day-to-day work and fun.
