Here's what it took to get my data out of QuickBooks Online.

1. Log in with 
* Internet Explorer to request an export of my data. 
* VirtualBox for OS X
* Free images of Windows running Internet Explorer (legally) available from Modern.ie
* Use the command line to compile the Windows image from `.rar` files into one executable file that VirtualBox can read and import,
* Downloading almost 1.5 GB of data to get a virtual instance of Internet Explorer running.
* Running VirtualBox
* Installing ActiveX on IE 11 in VirtualBox
* Click button to request data from QuickBooks[^yesabutton].
* Wait for an email.
* Click on link in email and then get notice that I need Internet Explorer to download the data (apparently file downloads are special to IE).
* Decipher why I couldn't see the downloaded files in Windows unless I was selecting a location to download.
* **A decade of web development experience to know that these tools exist and how to use, and troubleshoot them.**


[^yesabutton] Yes, I had to do all of the previous just to click a button to request the data.
