It doesn't look good for Tom. 

I saw Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers play twice (maybe three times? it's foggy). I saw him each time with a friend who was my concert going buddy for several years (after being my grad school prof for a couple). 

My biggest takeway from those shows was that they are a group of total professionals who had mastered their craft. They were tight, dialed in, and never messed up. They also didn't shy away from playing their biggest hits.

In undergrad I delivered a lot of pizzas. And that also meant that I listened to hundreds of hours of music while driving. I have specific memories--flashbacks even--that place me in a specific location listening to a specific song. I have a lot of those moments for Petty songs, especially off Wildflowers, which was released the Fall of my sophmore year in college. 

There was that traffic light at Main St and Baird Lane where _It's Good to be King_ was playing. Or driving down S. Church Street heading back from a motel delivery with _Yer So Bad_ blasting from the box speakers in the back my baby blue pickup truck.

I don't listen to his music much these days because I have those memories locked in and don't want disrupt them or unintentionally shake them loose. I'll occassionally listen to some times just to get a taste again. And tonight is as good of a day as ever.
