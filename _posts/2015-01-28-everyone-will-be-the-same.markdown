North Carolina basketball assistant coach Hubert Davis:

> One of the things that we tell the guys is that you have to do more than what is required. At some point in your career whether it is high school, college, or the NBA, youâ€™re going to be at a level where every guy can do the same things that you can do. So what is going to differentiate yourself between you and the other guy that is just as talented is your willingness everyday to work on your fundamentals and your craft, before and after practice.
