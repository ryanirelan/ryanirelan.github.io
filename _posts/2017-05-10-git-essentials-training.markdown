One of the most important and popular topics I [teach over at Mijingo is Git](https://mijingo.com/git-essentials). Back when I was working at an agency I helped onboard designers and developer to Git. It wasn't always easy because Git isn't easy. Sure, the first few commands are; we can easily memorize `git-add`, `git-commit`, or `git-merge`. But beyond that or when things go wrong? *crickets*

Not to get too sales pitchy here on my personal site but that problem above? That's why I created my Git courses. I asked customers what was missing from those courses and added even more videos to fill it out. 

Together they make Git Essentials, 40+ videos and 6 hours of training. It's a soups to nuts training on Git.

I'm really proud of it. [Check it out](https://mijingo.com/git-essentials).
