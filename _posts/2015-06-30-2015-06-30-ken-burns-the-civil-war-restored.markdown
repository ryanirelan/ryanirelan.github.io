I just finished watching Ken Burns' 1990 classic _The Civil War_ (mentioned earlier in [my post about Shelby Foote](http://ryanirelan.com/2015/06/28/shelby-foote-at-home.html)). I binged watch the series over the last several days (it's about 9 hours of viewing) and I will watch it again this fall when PBS re-releases a completely restored version.

The Netflix version of _The Civil War_ was in pretty rough shape for a show that is only 25 years old.
