A couple weeks ago I linked to [Manton's post about his first year indie](http://www.manton.org/2016/08/1-year-indie.html) and I noted that establishing as many constants as possible helps ease stress. The example I gave was establishing a payroll to pay myself. Of course, I still have to generate the revenue to support the payroll but you'd be surprised how much simpler that is if you know that payroll will hit on a certain day. There's no "maybe" or "I'll pay myself late"; you have to hit your mark every month (I pay myself monthly). That'll keep things lined up and running smoothly.
