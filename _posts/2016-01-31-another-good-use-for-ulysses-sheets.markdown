Ben Brooks highlighted another good use of the Sheets feature in Ulysses for building his email newsletter. 

I [use Sheets for my course writing for Mijingo](http://ryanirelan.com/2016/01/12/using-ulysses-for-writing.html) so I can reorder course sections as needed. I don't merge them all together like Ben does for his newsletter, instead opting to only glue them together. This gives me a better overview of the course sections.
