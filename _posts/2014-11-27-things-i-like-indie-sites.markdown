As a fellow indie business/publisher person, I make it a core value to support other indie publishers with my money. It's an investment back in to the ecosystem that keeps us warm (or most months here in Texas, _cool_) and fed.

There are plenty of places to get something similar to what a lot of indie publishers do. It's not the same, of course, but for some it's close enough. For me--and my work at [Mijingo](https://mijingo.com/)--it's always a challenge to fight for attention among well-funded companies that offer similar training courses.

The same goes for so many other people, like technology writers and pundits, and software developers and publishers.

I'm sharing this list to show my gratitude for these folks who share their ideas and products with us, and on their own terms and time.

* [Anita Sarkeesian](http://www.feministfrequency.com/about/) - 
* Shawn Blanc - 
* Manton Reece - I've known Manton for more than a decade. He was an unknowing mentor of mine at my first job, and someone who've I've admired for his insitence on creating products and services that matter to him. I donate to Manton every quarter, and you can, too.
* Matt Gemmell - The end of this year marks the first full year that Matt has been a full-time writer.
* John Gruber - He may be big time now, but John started by bootstrapping his indie gig through fundraising and dedication to publishing his way. He built his reputation and traffic piece by piece.
* Ben Brooks - 
* BRett Terpstra
* Pro Publica - not really indie but a worthy non-profit news organization doing amazing work, especially their web development team. If I was employable, this place would be my dream job.
