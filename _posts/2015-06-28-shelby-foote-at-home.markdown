I've been watching the classic Ken Burns documentary _The Civil War_ and got sidetracked by the main historian used throughout the series, Shelby Foote. This video of a tour of his work area in his home in Memphis has quite a few gems of the prolific historian and writer. This was recorded about 5 years before Foote died in 2005.

Foote was a last minute addition to the Burns documentary but became a core part of the documentary and a sensation from his witty facts and stories (well, as much as a sensation as you can become from being in a Ken Burns documentary).

Sales of Foote's fiction and non-fiction books, especially his three-part series on the Civil War, took off after his appearance in the documentary, making him a lot of money.

>  His three-part narrative had sold around 30,000 copies since the first volume came out in 1958; in the year after Foote appeared in The Civil War, he’d sold 400,000 sets. “Ken,” he told the director, “you’ve made me a millionaire.”

The first 30-40 minutes of the [three hour segement](http://www.c-span.org/video/?165823-1/depth-shelby-foote) are worth watching but all of it is a wonderful look at this important writer.
