A documentary (just out on Netflix yesterday) about living with less and in smaller places.

My immediate thoughts on it after watching it last night: 

* Good message
* Too narrow of a slice of society. Every person in the film is similar. I'd bet there are non-San Francisco -Portland, etc. people who are interested in minimalism.
* Felt like it was speaking to its existing tribe (validation!) instead of reaching out. Progessive issues like this are doomed if they're always looking inward.
* It focused so much on tiny houses but that's a _tiny part_ of minimalism. Tiny houses are hard to identify with (I'd never live in one). There are other parts of minimalism that _are_ easier to identify with, like tying it close to finances, using your money wisely (as if it was 1:1 with emotional energy), and knowing that you don't need _more_ to be happy.

All in all, a good film but it misses on many levels. It was done in a way to not be broadly appealing to those who aren't already interested. The real potential audience for this are people who are looking to shed over-consumption. This film makes minimalism look kind of like a freak show that only consists of the eccentric lot.
