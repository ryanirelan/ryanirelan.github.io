title: "A Review of the film My Run"
---

Since I started running 9 months ago I’ve been curious about others’ running experiences, especially people on the edges: those who are elite and pushing the boundaries in distance and speed, and those who are new to running and doing something amazing.

That drew me to the story of Terry Hitchcock: a widower who lost his wife to cancer, and single father raising three kids. You probably heard his story back in the early 90s.

Inspired by [Terry Fox], who ran one-legged across Canada while fighting cancer to raise awareness for cancer research, Terry Hitchcock decided to run across several US states to raise awareness of the challenges facing single parents. A worthy cause for sure.

The documentary _My Run_ is about Terry Hitchcock’s journey running 75 marathons in 75 days going from Minnesota to Atlanta (just in time for the Olympic Games).

This amazing story and motivation by Terry has the makings of wonderful documentary. After all, it did win festival awards, including at its debut right here in Austin.

But the film didn't do Terry's wonderful story justice. It sold it short through choppy storytelling. There was no real arc to the story, no build up, just a mundane recounting of the timeline of Terry’s epic run.

As Terry progressed through his 75 days journey, the film was a headwind, holding back any sense of progress, drama, and excitement.

It seems like a such an easy story to tell (to a non-filmmaker like me).

Despite the experience of the film itself (in this case the medium is most definitely _not_ the message), I still recommend that you rent, stream, or buy the film and watch it. 

Get beyond the film treatment of the Terry’s story and admire, wince, and worry about someone’s determination to finish a near impossible feat.

I picked up a copy at my local library and that might be your best best, too, for finding the movie.
