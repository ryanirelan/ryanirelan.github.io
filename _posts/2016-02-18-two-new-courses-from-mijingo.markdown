This month I've released two new courses over at my day job. :) 

### Web Performance Testing

> The first step to making sure the web sites we build are not a burden on our visitors or customers is understanding how big the pages are while we are developing them. If we can become more aware of how our feature, design, and development decisions impact the performance of the website, we can address problems before they impact the site’s user experience.

> This course is all about the basics of testing your site while you design and develop. We will cover everything you need to know to get started with reliable and accurate performance testing of your projects.

It's about 2 hours of solid information on how to get started with web performance testing. This was in the works for a long time, so it's nice to have it out and in the world.

### Git: Under the Hood

Last Spring I did a half day session at the [Peers Conference](http://peersconf.com) in Philadelphia on the internal of Git. A couple months later I turned that into a one-time live online seminar. 

Now it's a short course that folks very comfortable with Git can use to learn just how Git work on the inside.

> We’re going to dig in to some theory behind Git and understand how some parts of Git work. We’ll get our hands dirty and a little greasy under the hood but at the end we’ll have a solid of understanding of just how Git works.
