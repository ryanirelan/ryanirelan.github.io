Dave, pointing to an [Ars article](https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/07/woman-goes-in-for-cataract-surgery-has-27-contact-lenses-removed-from-her-eye/) about a lady who had 27 contact lenses stuck in her eye, wonders what he would do next if he wasn’t able to retrieve a lost lens. 

I also had this happen after rubbing my eyes too hard while in the shower and one lens got stuck under my eye lid. I had to carefully retrieve it without damaging my eye. I was prepared for an emergency visit to the eye doctor. But I don’t think I’d just ignore it!
