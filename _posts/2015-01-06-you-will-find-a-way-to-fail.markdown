[Like others](https://unicornfree.com/2015/a-meditation-on-goals), I had lofty goals for 2014--especially the second half of the year--and I didn't meet them all. I got down on myself about that because I had only measured one thing and then deemed _everything_ a failure. 

Until I looked a little deeper (basically, I opened up Google Analytics and segmented the data).

And while I missed my big lofty goal that I had written on an index card taped my desk the last six months, I actually moved the needle considerably in some very non-flashy areas--but stuff that really matters.

The effort that I put in on marketing, writing, writing more, writing even more, and publishing made a big difference.

But if you're determined enough, you can find the data and slice it up just right to show that you failed.
