Mijingo and Environments for Humans are presenting the [ATX Web Film Series](http://atxwebfilmseries.com). The mission of this series is to screen relevant, insightful, and entertaining films for the Austin Tech community.

The first installment of the film series will be a double feature and takes place at 6pm on October 3, 2016 at Alamo Drafthouse on S. Lamar.

The two films are:

* _CODE: Deubugging the Gender Gap_
* _What Comes Next is the Future_

For all of the details of the event, [visit the website](https://atxwebfilmseries.com).

More on how this came about another time but, for now, I hope you'll grab a ticket and I'll see you there.
