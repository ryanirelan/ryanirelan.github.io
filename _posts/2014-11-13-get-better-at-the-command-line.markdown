I released two new courses over at [Mijingo](https://mijingo.com): [Command Line Fundamentals](https://mijingo.com/products/screencasts/command-line-fundamentals/) and [OS X Shell Tricks](https://mijingo.com/products/screencasts/os-x-shell-tricks/). Both are perfect for web designers and developers, whether you're comfortable on the command line or just getting started.
