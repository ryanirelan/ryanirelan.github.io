title: Send Basecamp To-Dos to OmniFocus
date: March 22, 2012
--- 

On my [old site](http://archive.ryanirelan.com) I posted an AppleScript that made it easy to move Basecamp to-dos from your email inbox right in to your OmniFocus inbox. The script was a hack of epic proportions (cobbled together with help from other scripts--credits in the source) but it worked. And, recently, people have been asking for it again. 

So, here it is: [Basecamp To-dos to Omnifocus](http://archive.ryanirelan.com/BasecampToDosToOmniFocus.zip) (zip)

As I [originally wrote](http://archive.ryanirelan.com/blog/entry/automate-omnifocus-tasks-from-basecamp-to-dos/) when posting the script back in 2008:

> Iâ€™m sure that I am one of many people who rely on both OmniFocus and Basecamp in their day-to-day work and task management. One of the things missing for me was a fairly automated way of getting To-dos out of Basecamp and into OmniFocus as tasks.

The [old instructions](http://archive.ryanirelan.com/blog/entry/automate-omnifocus-tasks-from-basecamp-to-dos/) should still work and the script itself should work without any problems (that's what I've been told). If you do have one, [let me know](http://twitter.com/ryanirelan).
