I like the Grateful Dead. Yes, my appreciation of them was late blooming. I didn't  know nearly as much as I do now after watching this great documentary on Jerry Garcia's co-founder Bob Weir. 

What a gift he brought to music.

Netflix bought worldwide rights to the film earlier this year and now it can reach even more people.  Like me.
