[Seth&#8217;s Blog: Bring me stuff that&#8217;s dead, please](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/03/bring-me-stuff-thats-dead-please.html):

> The drive-by technorati are well-informed, curious and always probing. They&#8217;re also hiding&#8230; hiding from the real work of creating work that matters, connections with impact and art that lasts. I love to hear about the next big thing, but I&#8217;m far more interested in what you&#8217;re doing with the old big thing.

Example: look at how local businesses are marketing and innovating on some of the oldest trades. 

I recently had a company come clean and regrout our master bath shower. They weren&#8217;t a general flooring company that did new floors, contract with builders and other similar work; they only did restoration of existing tiled installations. Marketing themselves as an alternative to ripping out the tiles and starting over, their pitch was: &#8220;Pay us to save you money.&#8221; Their marketing is brilliantly focused on that idea.
