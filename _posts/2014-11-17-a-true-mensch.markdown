Greg Storey has left the building. 

Last month he stepped down from his position at Happy Cog, thereby ending nearly a decade as an agency owner. I was fortunate--truly fortunate--to be tapped as his first hire back in 2006. He's the best example of generosity and kindness with time and resources (and with me, probably patience, too). There are people who would line up to work with him again. I know I would.
