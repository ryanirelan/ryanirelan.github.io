 Dave Winer:
 
> The universe exists on a scale that you can't even begin to comprehend if you're dreaming of doing something to it. The universe just laughs at your ambition. Hah! You're a mere speck of dust, says the universe, a speck that exists for an infinitesimally short period of time.

I don't agree with everything in the essay (there is still merit in trying to make the world better on a large scale) but I enjoy the writing. And, he's right: we are but a speck of dust.  Humble thyself.
