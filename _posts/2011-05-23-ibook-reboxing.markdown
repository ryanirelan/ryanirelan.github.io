title: iBook Reboxing
date: May 23, 2011

In preparation for our move to Austin, I've been cleaning out the attic and found the box for my old iBook from 2002.

The iBook was my first Apple computer. I was in grad school when I bought it so it was a huge purchase for me at the time. It hasn't been used in years and no longer turns on, so it was time to send it off to be recycled. 

Apple has a <a href="http://www.apple.com/recycling/computer/">computer recycling program</a>. They send you a Fedex authorization and you can ship your computer back to them for free. If the computer can be reused you might even get a small gift card. 

Since I found the original packaging, I gave the iBook an unceremonious reboxing and documented the event with these photographs.

Safe journey, old friend.
