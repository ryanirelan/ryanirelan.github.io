Minneapolis is #18, the highest ranked US city. Time for a visit.

I bike every day to my office, which is only 1.7 miles (by bike, 1.5 by car) from our home.

 Austin is working hard on being more bike-friendly. We have the weather for it and now we need more awareness (which increases safety) and infrastructure.
