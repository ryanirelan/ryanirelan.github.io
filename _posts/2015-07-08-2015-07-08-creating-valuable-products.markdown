Shawn Blanc shares how he went about creating a product (his Focus course) that offers tremendous value but at a price that makes it sustainable for him.

I've learned over at [Mijingo](https://mijingo.com) that pricing products for value is hard. And sometimes it's a guess. Hell, most of the time it is a guess. 

But when you hit it just right, where the value is really there, you have something that no one else does, and the customer is benefiting ten fold from the price paid, it's magical.

It's the best part of being in online education: teaching topics that the student can go out and turn into their own income or happiness.
