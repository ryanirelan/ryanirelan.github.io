Cameron Moll [posted his thoughts on &#8220;non-startups&#8221;](http://cameronmoll.tumblr.com/post/3031376012/for-non-startups-things-just-take-time) (those without significant funding to quickly add resources) In [my own business](http://mijingo.com) I&#8217;ve regularly run into the problem of everything taking *much* longer than I&#8217;d like. I find solace in Cameron&#8217;s conclusion:

> Accordingly, I'm growing convinced that, unless one works late nights and weekends like a Bay Area startup, it's difficult for an independent team of two or three to move much faster than a corporate team of twenty.

Of course, I already work many nights and weekends (because I also have a full-time position at Happy Cog) and still find it hard to move quickly on projects. 

The advantage of being slower is that I think I can create better products and be more deliberate and thoughtful with my business moves. My customers and my goals drive the business, not a Series A round of funding burning a hole in my business account.
