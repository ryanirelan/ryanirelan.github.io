The report has been linked to a lot. But it reinforced for me that I have no intention on using Chrome as my main browser again. 

With the upcoming updates to OS X in El Capitan, there's no compelling reason for me to use Chrome any longer. Pinned tabs are what we kept me recently.

El Capitan feels like a bunch of small decisions coming together for a great experience.
