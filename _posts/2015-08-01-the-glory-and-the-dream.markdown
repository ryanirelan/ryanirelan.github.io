John Dickerson has mentioned this enough that I finally picked up the MP3 audiobook from our library after an aborted attempt to read the paper version. 

My biggest impression coming away from it so far (and I'm _only_ six hours in) is that it makes our crazy political times seem fairly normal; it is just a rerun of the shenanigans we've seen before.

If you find yourself getting outraged by current political theater then reading some history might help you realize that it isn't the worst it's been. In fact, we've seen it all before. 

Well, not me.
