In the preface to his book [JavaScript Enlightenment](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027713.do), Cody Lindley briefly explained why he wrote the book:

> First, I must admit that I wrote this book for myself. Truth be told, I crafted this material so I could drink my own Kool-Aid and always remember what it tastes like. In other words, I wanted a reference written in my own words used to jog my memory as needed.

A _great_ reason to write a book.

What do you want to document for yourself?
