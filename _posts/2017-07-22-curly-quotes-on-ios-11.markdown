> iOS 11 includes Smart Punctuation, a feature that substitutes some forms of punctuation with those that are more typographically suitable (e.g., "straight" quotes with “smart” quotes). While this smart replacement is suited for writing, it can get in the way if you're a developer.

It should be smarter. Wrecks everything from coding to command line. Disabled.
