Today, June 27, 2014, is the last day of an 8-year adventure. It started with Greg Storey hiring me as the [first employee at Airbag Industries](http://www.airbagindustries.com/archives/airbag/dinkenflicka.php) and culminated with heading up all technology and development at [Happy Cog](http://happycog.com) as VP of Technology.

Nearly a decade of client work has [taught me a lot](http://cognition.happycog.com/article/7-lessons-in-8-years-of-client-services) along the way and afforded me the opportunity to work with amazing co-workers, clients, companies, and brands. Happy Cog is doing its best work yet.

Seven years ago I started writing my first book, and a year later I published my first screencasts. That slowly built up into a small, profitable, successful side business: [Mijingo](http://mijingo.com). I was diligent in balancing everything; I worked every evening and weekend for a few years so I could continue to publish learning materials while maintaining a full-time job.

Last year I had the generous opportunity from Greg Hoy and Greg Storey to partner with Happy Cog and work with the team on some courses. The result was the popular [The Happy Cog Way series of videos](http://mijingo.com/products/bundles/the-happy-cog-way/).

Starting on Monday, June 30th, I will be working full-time on [Mijingo](http://mijingo.com), following my passion to build training materials that help people, and growing a business that means a tremendous amount to me.

As Mijingo is now my full-time gig and living, there will be no shortage of updates from me, both here, [over at the Mijingo blog](http://mijingo.com), and [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/mijingo).

Let your friends, co-workers, and Uncle Charlie know about the [Mijingo training courses](http://mijingo.com/products) that help you get more from your tools with step-by-step learning.
