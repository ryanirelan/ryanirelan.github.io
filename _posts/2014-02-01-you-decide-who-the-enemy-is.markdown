title: You Decide Who the Enemy Is

Even an irreligious man such as myself is open to a bit of wisdom from a Roman Catholic saint:


> The enemy often tries to make us attempt and start many projects so that we will be overwhelmed with too many tasks, and therefore achieve nothing and leave everything unfinished. Sometimes he even suggests the wish to undertake some excellent work that he foresees we will never accomplish. This is to distract us from the prosecution of some less excellent work that we would have easily completed. He does not care how many plans and beginnings we make, provided nothing is finished. -- [Saint Francis de Sales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_de_Sales) from _[Finding God's Will for You](http://books.google.com/books/about/Finding_God_s_Will_for_You.html?id=AXoEAAAACAAJ)_
