Last week I released a brand new course over at Mijingo that covers [intermediate Git](https://mijingo.com/products/screencasts/intermediate-git-tutorial/) usage. The course is 3 modules and several videos and is aimed at helping you go from a normal Git user (git-add, git-commit, etc) to someone with some power moves like git-bisect, git-revert, and customizing the output of the git log.

The course is 114 minutes long and includes a free, written course workbook, slides, and a long list of additional resources for you to use.
