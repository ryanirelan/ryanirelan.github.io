Not long ago I tweeted that [it's easier to blog on my iOS devices than on my laptop](https://twitter.com/ryanirelan/status/695614263340085249). I've been working with a couple new ways to write and publish with Jekyll. One of them is the `vim-jekyll` plugin. Pretty great but I wish it had multiple template support.
