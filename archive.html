	<p>I've moved some select and recent entries from the <a href="http://archive.ryanirelan.com">old site</a> over to this new site. This is almost everything I've written on the site starting in February 2011.</p>
	<p>My entire archives going back to 2001 can be found at <a href="http://archive.ryanirelan.com">archive.ryanirelan.com</a>. They are stored there as a snapshot of the past and all URLs have been properly redirected so no inbound links are broken.</p>
