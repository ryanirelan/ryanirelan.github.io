Here are some roles in which I can help you:

* *Technical Sales Research & Pitching* - I've researched, estimated, helped pitch and close projects with budgets from $5,000 to $500,000. The budgets don't really matter much when it comes to making and preventing mistakes. I've learned from the mistakes of under-bidding, mis-scoping (that one feature that ended up being a budget buster), and scope creep. **You deserve more time and money for the projects you're doing. I can help you get it**.
* *Hiring Assistance* - I like working with thinking, feeling, compassionate humans. Those are the types of people I've hired in the past. I think you should hire them, too. They make better a better company.
* *Development Team Mentoring* - I'm particularly interested in working with junior teams. My mentoring approach is to teach reusable concepts for approaching, planning, and successfully delivering web development projects on time and on budget.
* *Agency Owner/Development Manager Mentoring* -  I'll help you understand your developers, how to think like them, and make your work environment and projects give them what they need to be happy humans that do good work.

### How does it work?

I book consulting in 1 week blocks. If you have a small project or need, we can work together for a week. If it's bigger than we can use as many weeks as needed to complete the project together.

Once you get in touch, I'll set up an initial Skype or phone call to learn more about your company, project, and team. Together we'll find out if we're a good fit. If we are, I'll send a payment link for the block duration you choose and then we'll get to work based on my availability.

We will work together for the duration of the consulting package (consecutive weeks only). My consulting hours are 8am-4pm Central Time, Monday-Thursday.

### Hi, I'm Ryan.

I’ve worked with software companies, both large and small. I’ve also got a considerable amount of client experience: I was the first employee at Airbag Industries, where we worked on redesigns for MSNBC and the Sundance Film Festival, and I eventually became the Vice President of Technology for Happy Cog, a leading design agency. At Happy Cog we worked on projects with companies and organizations like Ben & Jerry's, MTV, Stanford University, and BBVA Compass.

Throughout my career, I’ve worked in web development, including as a hiring manager for development teams. I’ve also scoped, pitched, and managed projects for the smallest non-profit up through the largest public company. I’d love to do the same for you.

Ready to talk about working together? No fancy forms here. [Email me for pricing and availability](mailto:ryan@mijingo.com?subject=Consulting%20Inquiry).
