Hired, managed, and mentored web developers. I was responsible for building an agency development team that ultimately comprised of 10 individuals of varying experience and backgrounds.

History of leading successful projects for clients from small non-profits up to major brands. My input ranged from focused tactical implementation details to broad, strategic vision for the technical approach for the project.

Scoped and participated in complex projects with multiple client partners where I had limited knowledge and context of the client partners workflows and platforms. The scoping process required establishing relationships with client partners, leading technical discovery, and giving a cost and time estimate that was realistic and profitable.
