   <title>Minimalism Documentary</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A documentary (just out on Netflix yesterday) about living with less and in smaller places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/153518223&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/153518223&quot;&gt;Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/theminimalists&quot;&gt;The Minimalists&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My immediate thoughts on it after watching it last night:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Good message&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Too narrow of a slice of society. Every person in the film is similar. I’d bet there are non-San Francisco -Portland, etc. people who are interested in minimalism.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Felt like it was speaking to its existing tribe (validation!) instead of reaching out. Progessive issues like this are doomed if they’re always looking inward.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It focused so much on tiny houses but that’s a &lt;em&gt;tiny part&lt;/em&gt; of minimalism. Tiny houses are hard to identify with (I’d never live in one). There are other parts of minimalism that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; easier to identify with, like tying it close to finances, using your money wisely (as if it was 1:1 with emotional energy), and knowing that you don’t need &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; to be happy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, a good film but it misses on many levels. It was done in a way to not be broadly appealing to those who aren’t already interested. The real potential audience for this are people who are looking to shed over-consumption. This film makes minimalism look kind of like a freak show that only consists of the eccentric lot.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Save Articles to DEVONthink Like Instapaper</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2016/11/28/save-articles-to-devonthink-like-instapaper.html"/>
   
   <updated>2016-11-28T13:42:45-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2016/11/28/save-articles-to-devonthink-like-instapaper</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite ways to save articles into DEVONthink is as OCR’d PDFs with simple formatting. That simple formatting? A la Instapaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instapaper has a very nice formatting style that makes web articles saved as PDFs readable and printable. I don’t save the article to read later, I save them to reference later. It’s important to me that they are self-contained (not links) and easy to read (not web archives).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve that I use the Chrome extension to capture a web page with DEVONthink. When capturing I use PDF (Paginated) as the format and check “Reformat with Instpaper.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mijingo.d.pr/iwAt/4JJxUhDU+&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In DEVONthink I get a paginted and OCR’d PDF with simple formatting. Any links are kept intact (but moved to parathenses) and at the bottom and top are links back to the source article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mijingo.d.pr/YeMv/3huXgYWM+&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main use case for this method is when doing reesarch and planning for a new course. I’ll save articles I find and then store them in DEVONthink for later reference. I’ve tried several ways to save web articles in DEVONthink and this is the best I’ve found.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the last year I’ve been using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2gazHa1&quot;&gt;Infinity Wallet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as my every day wallet. I’m not a regular cash carrier so I use this wallet almost exclusviely for cards. It will stretch to fit as many cards as you need and then snap back when you downsize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Infinity Wallet has two slots on each side to hold cards and a middle area (that is open on both ends) to easily slide in cash. The tension from the wallet and cards keeps whatever is in the middle space secure. I like to use this middle space for temoporary items, like parking tickets or hotel room key cards.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Every venture-funded company has to cross the chasm to profitability, and we decided the time was now,” Carson wrote in an email to EdSurge. After today’s layoff, he expects the company to be “very close to profitable [as year-over-year] revenue growth for the last six years has been climbing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have to use terms like “crossing the chasm to profitability” things are most likely not good.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago I linked to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.manton.org/2016/08/1-year-indie.html&quot;&gt;Manton’s post about his first year indie&lt;/a&gt; and I noted that establishing as many constants as possible helps ease stress. The example I gave was establishing a payroll to pay myself. Of course, I still have to generate the revenue to support the payroll but you’d be surprised how much simpler that is if you know that payroll will hit on a certain day. There’s no “maybe” or “I’ll pay myself late”; you have to hit your mark every month (I pay myself monthly). That’ll keep things lined up and running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But despite the compelling nature of this “Netflix of Education” vision, it can encourage a misleading view of personalized learning. Examining several key areas where the educational Netflix analogy breaks down can help us better understand the qualities of an effective personalized learning solution. Failure to appreciate these points will result in personalized learning products more likely to hinder than help students.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;L. humile isn’t your stereotypical ant, with one queen and many workers laboring in a single nest. Argentine ants have multiple queens per colony, and there can be as many as 300 queens for every 1,000 workers. This makes them virtually impossible to kill with poison bait traps, which work on the principle that workers bring the tasty toxins back to the queen, whose death destroys the colony. When you have a lot of queens, that’s not an effective strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Proper Index Cards</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure what happened with index cards. Most of the cards you can buy now are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; cut from card stock but instead a heavyweight paper stock.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:notapaperexpert&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:notapaperexpert&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do not want those. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.staples.com/Oxford-3-inch-x-5-inch-Heavy-Weight-Lined-Ruled-White-Index-Cards-100/product_71737&quot;&gt;You want these. Oxford 3x5 Heavy weight index card &lt;/a&gt; (I’ll leave lined or unlined up to you–I prefer lined).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My local office supply didn’t have them the last time I ordered, so I used Amazon. I just looked and even Amazon isn’t carrying them (third party sellers were but I don’t use them because they’re price gougers). You might want to stock up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative is the excellent looking &lt;a href=&quot;http://nockco.com/paper/dotdash-3-x-5-note-cards&quot;&gt;DotDash notecard by Nock Co.&lt;/a&gt; They are quite a bit more expensive but you will get quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My video on how I create courses for &lt;a href=&quot;https://mijingo.com&quot;&gt;Mijingo&lt;/a&gt; explains how I use notecards:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I’m not a paper expert so if I’m confusing the terms “card stock” and “heavy weight paper” please correct me. Let’s just one is too thin and the other is a proper index card, deal? &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:notapaperexpert&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But I also have to admit that when you’re the father of two daughters, you become even more aware of how gender stereotypes pervade our society. You see the subtle and not-so-subtle social cues transmitted through culture. You feel the enormous pressure girls are under to look and behave and even think a certain way.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Manton Reece on 1 Year Indie</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And I made a few decisions early on with how to manage the business that have proven useful to smooth over the bumps. For example, I pay myself a fixed salary on the 1st day of each month, and for 12 months straight I’ve always met that goal. This month, I gave myself a small raise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key to staying sane while on the indie bootstrapping path is to create as many constants as possible. For me, setting up automatic payroll has been one of those constants that reduces worry. It’s like automatically paying your monthlty bills; you have to do it, so make it automatic and then focus on other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Bastrop State Park</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bastrop-state-park.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bastrop State Park&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last weekend we did a quick one night camping trip at Bastrop State Park. We were here last Septemeber for the Burning Pine 10k race I ran. Even though the hilly park road had me finding a little religion around mile 5, I really enjoyed the park and wanted to return for a more relaxed adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bastrop State Park was hit hard by two disasters in four years: the 2011 wildfires during an awful central Texas drought, and the 2015 Memorial Day flooding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2011 wildfires took out 97% of the pine trees in the park. Almost five years later, the carnage is striking and eery. I’m no forester but I’d guess it’ll take decades or a century to return to a rich pine tree forest (if ever at all).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year’s flooding (which also hit Austin metro area) drained the small park lake after it overflowed and breached a dam/roadway and emptied into the surrounding area, destroying a park road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bastrop State Park is very nicely outfitted park for tent and RV camping. Nice sites, facilities, and a YMCA-run swimming pool. We’ll definitely return.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;After just 24 hours, the computer note takers typically forgot material they’ve transcribed, several studies said. Nor were their copious notes much help in refreshing their memory because they were so superficial.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Design for Real Life - Eric Meyer & Sara Wachter-Boettcher</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2016/03/21/design-for-real-life-eric-meyer-sara-wachter-boettcher.html"/>
   
   <updated>2016-03-21T04:49:42-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2016/03/21/design-for-real-life---eric-meyer--sara-wachter-boettcher</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spend more time now refining the things I already know instead of just learning something new. Sure, I still learn new stuff (I do teach for living after all) but I’m also constantly adjusting my dials for better reception of the world around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be engaging more deeply in relationships, understanding my own cycles of energy and emotions and adjusting my schedule around those to make life a bit more pleasant and fruitful, or being more empathetic and in-tune with how my work affects others. As a professional teacher and riffraff academic, this is the most important thing I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Meyer and Sara Wachter-Boettcher have a similar mission for us and the websites we design and build. They pull from personal experiences of bumping up against the edges of a design or content decision and together wrote &lt;em&gt;Design for Real Life&lt;/em&gt;, a 140-page manifesto on creating websites that feel a little more human when humans need it most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the book is to “bring edge cases to the center”, as Anil Dash writes in the Introduction. Using case studies of how things can go wrong, and documenting the techniques we can use in our next project to improve your website, web application, or product, Sara and Eric helped me see a bit wider than my own life experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book starts by confronting how we see the audience for which we design and develop sites. And, how, no matter how thoughtful we might think we are being, our decisions can create an awful experience for someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On Christmas Eve 2014, I went to Facebook and was greeted by an ad promoting Year in Review, a feature I had been deliberately avoiding. But there it was in my newsfeed. Staring out at me, framed by dancing clip-art partygoers: the face of my middle child, Rebecca, who had died of aggressive brain cancer on her sixth birthday, June7th, 2014.The dissonance between that profound personal tragedy and theparty images created a visceral moment of shock. The copy, “Here’s what your year looked like!” added its own surreal layer of horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could easily cast stones and quip: “Oh those young Silicon Valley kids have such a narrow, pampered view of life,” but that’s not at all what &lt;em&gt;Design for Real Life&lt;/em&gt; is about. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; about forcing us to see beyond our own world but it &lt;em&gt;is not&lt;/em&gt; about scolding us for making mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will make mistakes. But the book offers tools and processes for helping to uncover those mistakes before they make it to your customer or user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is also not advocating that we try to build something that won’t offend anyone or never have an edge that someone could bump into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If we tried to avoid every possible trigger for every possible person, we’d never build anything at all. But by being intentional about what we ask of our users in the first place, and communicating the context for every interaction as clearly and transparently as possible, we’ll greatly limit the ways we can harm or traumatize them, and also make it easier for them to forgive us when we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design for Real Life&lt;/em&gt; book illuminated the blind spots in my vision of my work. It teaches a very important refinement and improvement to the work we do designing and building for the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t let the slim stature of the book fool you: it is a big and important work. We should all feel obligated to &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; read &lt;em&gt;Design for Real Life&lt;/em&gt; but hopefully also build the concepts and methods in the book into our future work.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I like to think that floats are the dirty little secret of web developers everywhere: we know enough about them to use them but we all secretly fear them. We fear them in a way that maybe they’ll come to life one day and hunt us down, like zombies looking to expand their fleet of walking dead. We furiously type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;clear:both;&lt;/code&gt; anywhere we can find space &lt;em&gt;but nothing happens&lt;/em&gt;. They’re still chasing us.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life - Russ Roberts</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2016/02/29/how-adam-smith-can-change-your-life-russ-roberts.html"/>
   
   <updated>2016-02-29T03:02:47-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2016/02/29/how-adam-smith-can-change-your-life---russ-roberts</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am not well-versed in economics nor many specifics of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith&quot;&gt;Adam Smith&lt;/a&gt; other than that he wrote a book of which I’ve heard: &lt;em&gt;The Wealth of Nations&lt;/em&gt;. However, I was intriuged by the idea of taking Adam Smith’s secondary work–_&lt;a href=&quot;http://econlib.org/library/Smith/smMS.html&quot;&gt;The Theory of Moral Sentiments&lt;/a&gt;_ published in 1759–and reading through a lens of modern life and living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’ll be honest: this book was a slog for me after the first one third or so. I don’t fault the author for this. I think the material lends itself to explanations that are drawn out and over-explanatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economist Russ Roberts takes Smith’s work and breaks it down into chapters that are the ways in which Adam Smith can change our lives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to Know Yourself&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to Be Happy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How Not to Fool Yourself&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to Be Loved&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to Be Lovely&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to Be Good&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to Make the World a Better Place&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How Not to Make the World a Better Place&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to Live in the Modern World&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapter titles read like the contents of a third-rate self help book at the mall bookstore (Do mall bookstores still exist?) but they will fool you. The material in them is nothing of the sort. It’s quite good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so why is an economist writing a book about living a better life, which is based on a book by an 18th century philosopher and economist?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economics isn’t just about money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Economics helps you understand that money isn’t the only thing that matters in life. Economics teaches you that making a choice means giving up something. And economics can help you appreciate complexity and how seemingly unrelated actions and people can become entangled. These insights and others are sprinkled throughout &lt;em&gt;The Theory of Moral Sentiments&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then we’re off, as Roberts launches deep into the nine ways you can improve your life through Adam Smith. Russ Roberts successfully dusts off a centuries old work and applies it to the modern day.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big - Scott Adams</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2016/02/28/how-to-fail-at-almost-everything-and-still-win-big.html"/>
   
   <updated>2016-02-28T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2016/02/28/how-to-fail-at-almost-everything-and-still-win-big</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The subtitle of this book is “Kind of the Story of My Life” and that summarizes the content. Scott Adams takes his life experience, specifically how he was able to overcome failure in life and career, and weaves it into a narrative that gives you steps and practical advice for improving your own life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve read any of Scott’s blog posts over the years you will recognize the style. The book reads like a collection of his blog posts (but I don’t think it is). Scott is introspective and analytical about his experience in the world; he seeks how his actions affect him (and others) and how he can change things for maximum happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The only reasonable goal in life is maximizing your total lifetime experience of something called happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a typical “life hack” book but it does have a lot of that same type of instruction: here’s my one-time or limited experience and how it helped me achieve X. You should now do this, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except that Adams regularly tells you that he can’t claim that any of this will work for you, or even that his experience (and the scientific studies and literature he cites)  proves anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott Adams gets a lot of flack online for his blog posts, many of which are grand thought experiments on controversial topics. Many readers of his blog react in a predictable way by chiding him for his lack of grip on reality. If your mind is of such width that you aren’t able to follow along with Scott as he journeys through another thought experiment on everything from psychology to employment to finances, then you shouldn’t read this book. It will drive you mad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big&lt;/em&gt; regularly touches on psychology as a map to navigate life. He writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Knowledge of psychology is the purest form of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adams claims that you can &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; benefit from understanding how the mind interprets the world. There is no objective reality and if we approach the world and life like there is then we’ll be disappointed by the results. You have to know how others see the world, not just how you perceive it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite things about the book is that he advocates for broad, ongoing learning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everything you learn becomes a shortcut for understanding something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simple example Adams gives is if you wanted to understand what a zebra is. It’s easier to describe and explain what a zebra is if you already know a horse. Oh, it’s a horse but with stripes. Easy enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By having knowledge of one thing you create hooks, as he calls them, for understanding other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest takeaway from this book–and it could’ve been a book of its own–is the idea that we should be using systems not goals to be sucessful (as we define it for ourselves) and happy in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A goal is to lose 15 lbs by April 1st. You do whatever you can to meet it but you’re probably racing toward that goal with blinders on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A system is a regular, maintinable routine of activities that make that happen not just once but ongoing. You are not “losing 15 lbs,” you are living a healthy life that keep you at a healthy weight. Instead of starving yourself for a month, which isn’t maintinable at all over an extended period, you set up a system of meals that are good for you. You build exercise into your day (like changing to a bike commute instead of loafing in your car the 4 miles).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the chapters are short and fast to read. You could read them out of order but he does reference previous material as the books moves on toward the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read the 200 or so pages very quickly. The prose are simple and approachable. Scott cites research papers and other sources of the information he uses to make his arguments. Even if you find the book a lighter read, you can very easily trawl the footnotes for deeper learning.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using The NERD tree as a file explorer for vim. It was a bit quirky at first but that was me not knowing how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have trained myself to be fairly fast using it but only because I’ve tried to be disciplined about looking up commands if I didn’t know them. It takes more willpower than you think to break old habits (Sublime Text shortcuts, previously TextMate shortcuts) and groove in new ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, my vim setup (which is one of my experiements at this point) is decent. I like using it but it still feels like a lot of work to do basic daily functions.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From the Comma Queen at the New Yorker:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The serial comma, also known as the Oxford comma, is the one before “and” in a series of three or more: Herman Melville wrote “Moby-Dick,” “Billy Budd,” and “Bartleby, the Scrivener.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It is also the improbable subject of a passionate debate among scholars, journalists, and copy editors. Can’t we all just get along?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me? I use the serial comma because it creates clarity. Everything from the Comma Queen is worth your time.

   <title>Dave's Scripting News</title>

   <updated>2016-02-20T10:16:38-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2016/02/20/daves-scripting-news</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been reading Dave for more than a decade. Since 2001, maybe? I don’t recall exactly. Maybe it has been 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time I was still freshly back on US soil after a stint living in Germany (and learning German, and getting married). Back in school and with a bit more cash than during my time abroad, I started rekindling my relationship with technology, computers, and the web, after almost two years without regular internet or even an email address. Reading Dave’s Scripting News was a large part of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read Dave through his heart attack, the RSS/Atom battle, and who knows what else. Dave strikes me as someone who is open about what he’s up to. He’s been blogging prolifically since blogging was a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and he also helped invent podcasting. You know how podcast episodes are delivered via an enclosure in the RSS feed? That was Dave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why am I writing this? We need to stay connected to people who help (Dave continues to help, so this isn’t a salute to an old timer) create the space in which we work and make our livelihoods. It’s also been fun to observe him working in the Node.js and server-side JavaScript space, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com&quot;&gt;read his blog&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t already. Subscribe to the RSS feed (the best way, of course) or pop in now and then to read his thoughts on politics, technology, and anything else that might be on his mind. He’s been a must-read for me for years.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Web Performance Testing & Git Internals</title>

   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2016/02/18/two-new-courses-from-mijingo</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This month I’ve released two new courses over at my day job. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;web-performance-testing&quot;&gt;Web Performance Testing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The first step to making sure the web sites we build are not a burden on our visitors or customers is understanding how big the pages are while we are developing them. If we can become more aware of how our feature, design, and development decisions impact the performance of the website, we can address problems before they impact the site’s user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This course is all about the basics of testing your site while you design and develop. We will cover everything you need to know to get started with reliable and accurate performance testing of your projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about 2 hours of solid information on how to get started with web performance testing. This was in the works for a long time, so it’s nice to have it out and in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mijingo.com/products/screencasts/web-performance-testing/&quot;&gt;See course page for all the details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;git-under-the-hood&quot;&gt;Git: Under the Hood&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Spring I did a half day session at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://peersconf.com&quot;&gt;Peers Conference&lt;/a&gt; in Philadelphia on the internal of Git. A couple months later I turned that into a one-time live online seminar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it’s a short course that folks very comfortable with Git can use to learn just how Git work on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’re going to dig in to some theory behind Git and understand how some parts of Git work. We’ll get our hands dirty and a little greasy under the hood but at the end we’ll have a solid of understanding of just how Git works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Gitlab is a longer term choice for me because their model is much more sustainable. I’m looking more and more to bring my tools in-house. Gitlab lets me do that by hosting my own repositories with their excellent software.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Wash Your Hands</title>
   
   <link href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2016/01/29/how-to-wash-your-hands-like-a-doctor/"/>
   
   <updated>2016-01-31T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2016/01/31/how-to-wash-your-hands</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When it comes to the latter, proper and regular hand-washing is one of the most important weapons in your cold and flu-fighting arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those folks that know me well (hi, former co-workers) are aware that I am particularly careful about clean hands. I don’t think I’m a germaphobe (but have been told I am, which is a misunderstanding) but I do care that I and everyone else properly wash hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are male (I can only speak from my own experience) and have been in a public bathroom, especially an airport bathroom, you’ll know from anecdotal experience that  &lt;em&gt;a lot of people don’t wash their hands properly or, I hate to say it, wash them at all&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proper hand washing (as illustrated in the linked article) isn’t only about preventing the spread of the common cold, flu, Norovirus  or, god forbid, E. coli. It’s about proper hygienic care as a respectful human in a larger community. Disease and illness can be prevented by individual effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At our home we’re not hyper about hand washing but we have a few basic protocols:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When we come home from anywhere, we: take off shoes/jacket and then immediately wash hands.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wash hands before a meal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do I even have to say that you have to wash hands after using the bathroom?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t like to engage in judging others but there’s no reason–none at all–to not wash your hands properly after using the restroom. Especially those disgusting public bathrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A free public library is a revolutionary notion, and when people don’t have free access to books, then communities are like radios without batteries. You cut people off from essential sources of information — mythical, practical, linguistic, political — and you break them. You render them helpless in the face of political oppression.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One of the few workable business models in this age of digital disruption has been to produce as much content as cheaply as possible.

   <title>Writing with Ulysses</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2016/01/12/using-ulysses-for-writing.html"/>
   
   <updated>2016-01-12T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2016/01/12/using-ulysses-for-writing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A while back I switched to using &lt;a href=&quot;http://ulyssesapp.com&quot;&gt;Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; for my writing. I switched from my normal setup of Markdown files in BBEdit and Marked app because I wanted something that gave me more control over organizing (and visualizing) my writing and easier access on all devices. I don’t write here a lot  but I am writing almost daily on upcoming courses for Mijingo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;https://mijingo.com/learn&quot;&gt;courses for Mijingo&lt;/a&gt; can be big in terms of the number of words. 10,000 words plus code examples isn’t unusual. When using BBEdit  I had one big Markdown file with each module or section of the course as a different top-level header. But reorganizing the course content wasn’t always straightforward (but it was easy to make an error, like that time I deleted a bunch of content) and I didn’t have a good visual of the overall structure of the course.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:mindmap&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:mindmap&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I went hunting for a Markdown app that would make that easier. Let me be clear: I’m wary of all-in apps that take over your content is some proprietary file format or package.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:evernote&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:evernote&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The reason I moved this blog to Jekyll several years ago is because I wanted to future proof my content. I need the same with my courses. But it could not come at the cost of even minor inconvenience that would slow me down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because let’s be honest: when it comes to writing we need to grease the wheels as much as possible just to get the writing done. I’d love to have some purist plain text file setup that’d earn me nerd cred accolades from the nerderati but nerd cred a) doesn’t write courses and b) pay the bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing and publishing pay the bills. Sorry, fellow nerds. Plus I’m almost 41 and who has time for unnecessary obstacles anymore?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I needed something that was somewhere in the middle. And that something was Ulysses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my requirements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Easy, automatic syncing. Dropbox okay, iCloud okay, but preferably not something run by the app.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Markdown support&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A way to structure writing by creating collections or linking multiple documents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Simple exporting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Universal, 360 degree access. I wanted to be able to write and edit my work on all of my devices (MacBook Air, iPad, iPhone Giant).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ulysses hit all of those (except iPhone but that’s coming and it’s fantastic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my setup:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Courses are Collection at the top level, synced via iCloud.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each course is also a Collection inside of the courses collection, in which I have separate sheets for each section of the course (or even broken down into multiple sheets per section depending on the length)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inside the course Collection is another Collection called “Research”. This is where I drop in links, quotes, or idea. I’ve recently revamped this part and “Research” has become more of a scratch pad. More on that another time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I’m syncing via iCloud all of my writing is always available on my iOS devices, MacBook Air, and Mac Pro. I’m on the beta group of the new iOS version of Ulysses which has support for iPhone. I have sat in bed, on my iPhone 6 Plus, and reorganized and edited course content. Works like a charm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I’m done writing I can export out the course in one of multiple formats available (PDF, ePub, plain text, HTML, etc). I typically export out to Markdown or PDF, depending on what I need it for. I go to PDF if it’s for publishing with a course (I always try to share my written content as an ebook for each course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After thousands of words written, I’ve settled in on Ulysses. I traded off some future-proofing by going all in on Ulysses but I can get my stuff out pretty easily as plain old Markdown. The convenience  and ease of writing makes that trade-off worth it for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want another take on writing with Ulysses? &lt;a href=&quot;https://brooksreview.net/2016/01/ulysses-all-the-things/&quot;&gt;Check out Ben Brooks’ Ulysses setup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:mindmap&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I create mind maps for each course before I start writing but the course takes shape and morphs while I write. Therefore I need an easy way to see the course structure &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; reorganize it while I’m writing. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:mindmap&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:evernote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I learned the hard way with Evernote. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:evernote&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Running Gear</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2016/01/12/running-gear.html"/>
   
   <updated>2016-01-12T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2016/01/12/running-gear</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesweethome.com/reviews/the-best-running-gear/&quot;&gt;this list of running gear from The Sweet Home&lt;/a&gt; and I wish it had existed or I had seen it when I started gearing up about a year ago. It is a good list and doesn’t fall into the trap of approaching running gear the same way you would reviews of consumer products. The Sweet Home reviews were also done by experienced runners and a college running coach. Looks pretty legit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My running experience is limited. I have 4 races under my belt–from a 10k to a half marathon–and almost  12 months of regular 3-4x weekly running. I’m &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a running veteran but I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; still close to my experience of being new and figuring out which gear works for me. I thought it’d be helpful to share what I use and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shoes&quot;&gt;Shoes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started running I knew without a doubt that I needed good shoes that were properly fitted by someone who knows running and running shoes. I went to a local running store that had good reviews. We’re fortunate here in Austin that we have several good running stores from which to choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with the note in the The Sweet Home gear guide: giving recommendations for shoes is pointless unless I know your feet and gait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if I did (and I most certainly do not!) know your feet and gait, I am not qualified to tell you which shoe you should try on first. I have no idea what works for me beyond the two pairs I have. That’s why I go to my running store. The last time I was there, to buy a replacement pair of shoes after EOL’ing my original running shoes (you were awesome, dear Asics), I tried on about ten different pairs of shoes. I jogged in each of them as the store associate watched my feet. You can’t do this if you shop online or at a general purpose sporting goods store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything else gear-wise, while somewhat subjective, I can still give a recommendation on with at least a little hope that it’d be helpful to you. Take what you can, leave behind what you want. Here’s what works for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;running-socks&quot;&gt;Running Socks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeturesrunning.com&quot;&gt;Feetures High Performance Light Cushion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we’re skipping shoes, let’s start with socks. The baseline for socks is synthetic, not cotton. When I first started running I picked up several pairs of basic Asics socks at my local running store. I went through about 6 pairs of those before switching to &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeturesrunning.com&quot;&gt;Feetures socks&lt;/a&gt;. Those are the socks I use today. I run in a lightly padded version (“High Performance Light Cushion”) and use a thinner, tighter pair to wear for recovery after longer runs because they make my feet feel goooood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feetures main selling point is the seamless toe. This is supposed to make the socks more comfortable  (I’d agree with that). I really like them for running and recovery and haven’t had a problem with hot spots like I did with the Asics socks from time to time. Feetures aren’t inexpensive (about $12-15 &lt;em&gt;per pair&lt;/em&gt;) but they are worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;running-shorts&quot;&gt;Running Shorts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pd/5-challenger-running-shorts/pid-10298568/pgid-10298564&quot;&gt;Nike Challenger Shorts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was gearing up to start my running I didn’t know where to start with shorts ( or shirts for that matter). I did a bit of research and then went to the store to look through different brands. What I found is that Nike fit me best and I liked the quality. It was the right hunch because I’ve never had a single problem with either pair of Challengers I own. I run in 7” Challengers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;running-shirts&quot;&gt;Running Shirts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pd/dri-fit-contour-running-shirt/pid-10338164/pgid-10293969&quot;&gt;Nike Dri-Fit Contour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried on cheaper technical shirts (these are the moisture wicking shirts runners wear) but they were all cut much wider and sloppier than the more expensive brands. I went with Nike’s Dri-Fit Contour shirt. The black Dri-Fit shirt I bought during my initial gear-up is still in perfect shape after hundreds of miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wash all of my running clothes on a “hand wash” gentle cycle using mild detergent. Everything is hung up to air dry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pd/pro-cool-fitted-shirt/pid-10717888/pgid-10266828&quot;&gt;Nike Pro Cool Fitted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added this shirt over the Summer because I needed something even cooler than the normal Nike Dri-Fit. I really, really like this shirt. It doesn’t chafe ( you know where) and keeps me cool. Mine is also bright neon yellow so it has the added benefit of helping me be seen (and be safer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;running-hat&quot;&gt;Running Hat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brooksrunning.com/en_us/seattle-collapsible-hat/280323.html?dwvar_280323_color=001&amp;amp;dwvar_280323_size=OSFA#start=4&quot;&gt;Brooks Collapsible Hat &lt;/a&gt; (as close as I could find to my model)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not very smart so it took me a while to realize that shaving my head &lt;em&gt;plus&lt;/em&gt; profusely sweating while running would equal burning eyes as the sweat just rolls down my face. I finally smartened up and bought a  running hat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brooks running hat is black with reflective areas. It soaks up sweat and keep my head cool even in the Summer. It also keeps my head warm in cooler weather (but I don’t wear it for freezing temperatures, see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one of those purchases where I just needed the hat and I grabbed what they had at the store. Brooks is an excellent brand so I knew it’d be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hat has been through hundreds of miles on the road sitting atop my fat head. It has been washed a lot (again, via the gentle cycle) and hung up to dry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;running-watch&quot;&gt;Running Watch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://apple.com/watch&quot;&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I detailed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://ryanirelan.com/2015/09/24/my-one-use-case-for-apple-watch.html&quot;&gt;previous entry&lt;/a&gt; why I purchased an Apple Watch and how I planned to use it. In short, I needed an easy way to glance at Runkeeper’s (or Strava’s) realtime stats on my run. One flip of the wrist to check my pace (just to confirm that, yes, once again I’ve started out too fast) and mileage (oh god, am I done yet?!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a single piece of gear, this was the most expensive thing I have purchased specifically for running. But very, very much worth all of those dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;running-belt&quot;&gt;Running Belt&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spibelt.com/&quot;&gt;SPIBelt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I had my Apple Watch, I had to take my (giant) iPhone 6 Plus with me on runs so I could track my distance via Runkeeper.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:runkeeper&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:runkeeper&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big phone didn’t really work with arm bands (I have small arms so it’d be hard to keep it from bouncing around), so I needed a belt with a pouch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SPIBelt is slim, fits snugly, and, as an added bonus, is made right here in Austin, TX. I’ve used it on every run and race since I started running. It still looks like new (again, I wash it on a gentle cycle) and I could see it lasting years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;running-water-bottle&quot;&gt;Running Water Bottle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amphipod.com/products/hydration/bottles-handhelds/handhelds/hydraform-flash-hydrostrobe-thermal-12oz&quot;&gt; Amphipod Hydraform Flash Hydrostrobe Thermal 12oz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(That’s quite the product name.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first running bottle was a basic Nike bottle I picked up for $6. I only needed it to transport water from home to the local YMCA where I was taking a running class. I didn’t actually run with the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Spring turned  into hot Austin, TX Summer, and my running distances increased, I knew I needed to have water with me as I ran. My distance plus the heat would make a dangerous combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a bit of online research then visited my local running store and picked up the Amphipod. I chose the 12oz because I didn’t want to carry a giant water bottle with me. I knew I could refill it in the worst case scenario that I ran out of water (see tip below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the 12oz bottle proved too small I could always buy a larger bottle for super long runs (if I end up training for a marathon) and the 12oz would still be useful for shorter runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This water bottle has a pouch on the strap that makes it easy to store keys, ID, money, or gels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Tip: carry $5 with you when you run just in case you need to duck into a gas station or store to pick up an extra bottle of water or Gatorade.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;staying-warm-while-running&quot;&gt;Staying Warm While Running&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s lump the cold weather stuff all in one section. Quick disclaimer: I live in Austin, TX and it does not get very cold here. The coldest weather I run in is right at freezing. My experience might not work if you are running in Minnesota or some other place that has a real Winter. I live in the world of fake Winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nike-dri-fit-element-half-ziphttpstorenikecomusenuspddri-fit-element-half-zip-running-shirtpid-10300551pgid-11184971-in-black-and-volt-yellow&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pd/dri-fit-element-half-zip-running-shirt/pid-10300551/pgid-11184971&quot;&gt;Nike Dri-Fit Element Half Zip&lt;/a&gt; (in black and volt yellow)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This versatile long sleeve, half zip (for temperature control) shirt is an important part of my gear. I bought the black one first and this past Fall added the volt yellow one so I had something bright and warm to wear on cold mornings. The shirt zips up all the way so you can keep your lower neck warm. It also has thumb holes for extra hand warmth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When these wear out I’ll buy the same ones again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nike-element-thermal-20--runing-gloveshttpstorenikecomusenuspdelement-thermal-2-running-glovespid-10443550pgid-10443549&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pd/element-thermal-2-running-gloves/pid-10443550/pgid-10443549&quot;&gt;Nike Element Thermal 2.0  Runing Gloves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought these the week before my first half marathon. The temperatures were going to be cold enough that my hands would get cold (standing in the corral  waiting for the race to start). I already had a throw-away long sleeve shirt but needed gloves that could stay with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are not heavy winter gloves. They’re thin enough that if worn while not running your hands will get cold! They have touchscreen-friendly finger tips, which come in handy for tapping on my watch or phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though my hands warm up quickly on a run, I now wear these on every cold run and every bike ride. For a quick last-minute purchase, I couldn’t be happier with the gloves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nike-lightweight-running-sleeveshttpstorenikecomusenuspdlightweight-running-sleevespid-1488619pgid-1488620&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pd/lightweight-running-sleeves/pid-1488619/pgid-1488620&quot;&gt;Nike Lightweight Running Sleeves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet another pre-first half marathon purchase. Yes, I was a little worried about being comfortable in the colder temperatures while standing and waiting. These sleeves, like the gloves, are very lightweight and will not keep you warm without running. They’re just enough to protect your skin from the cold wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my first half marathon in San Antonio I wore them for the first few miles and then removed them and tucked them into my SPIBelt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wear them under the half-zip shirt (along with a DRI-FIT shirt) for extra warmth on cold mornings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rei-airflyte-running-tightshttpwwwreicomproduct853806rei-airflyte-running-pants-menscmmmccseplagoog--8538060004cawelaid120217890000753437lsft&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rei.com/product/853806/rei-airflyte-running-pants-mens?cm_mmc=cse_PLA_GOOG-_-8538060004&amp;amp;CAWELAID=120217890000753437&amp;amp;lsft=&quot;&gt;REI Airflyte Running Tights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t wear these often. I can run in shorts if it’s in the 30s but sometimes, especially in the early morning, I’m tired and weak and just want to be warm. I’m not thrilled with these and wouldn’t buy them again. I had a hard time finding tights/pants that I liked and fit me well. I had to buy them quickly before a trip to Salt Lake City last February (related: running at higher elevations is not fun).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;smartwool-the-lid-hathttpwwwreicomproduct870835smartwool-the-lid-hat-in-grey&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rei.com/product/870835/smartwool-the-lid-hat&quot;&gt;SmartWool The Lid Hat&lt;/a&gt; (in grey)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought this as a general purpose winter hat for my shaved head but it works perfectly has a winter running hat. I wear it on the coldest day and even if I’m wearing thin layers and shorts I still feel warm with this hat. I feel like it could last me decades. Excellent quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s my gear!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:runkeeper&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I still track today but not with the the same fervor I did when I started out. It was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; important to me whether I ran 3 miles or 3.1 miles. That’s the difference between not running and running a 5k, you know. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:runkeeper&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The universe exists on a scale that you can’t even begin to comprehend if you’re dreaming of doing something to it. The universe just laughs at your ambition. Hah! You’re a mere speck of dust, says the universe, a speck that exists for an infinitesimally short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t agree with everything in the essay (there is still merit in trying to make the world better on a large scale) but I enjoy the writing. And, he’s right: we are but a speck of dust.  Humble thyself.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Two Years No Booze</title>
   
   <link href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-sober-alcohol-drunk-booze-perspec-1231-20151230-story.html"/>

   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2016/01/01/two-years-no-booze</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Andy Boyle stopped drinking for two years and saw ( unsurprisingly) drastic changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’ve learned a lot in two years, so I thought I’d share that with you, in case you’d like to take a break from the booze cruise. Also, that’s what I tell myself: I’ve taken a break. Maybe I’ll drink again. Maybe I won’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But overall, life seems to be a whole lot better for me because I took a break. Perhaps it could be for you too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My drinking in 2015 went from very frequent (but very rarely in excess) to very infrequent (weeks at a time without a drink).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t a moral decision (as it also wasn’t with Boyle) but a practical one. I was spending so much time running and working toward a race that I saw the extra calories and how I felt the day after even one beer not worth it. So I just stopped making it a regular thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a break from drinking and some time to reflect on it, I was able to see how much it affected me. A little distance from drinking  made me more acutely aware of how I felt when I did have a drink or two. It definitely changed my mood and motivation into the next day.  That was surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure why I was more sensitive to how alcohol made me feel but I can only guess that when you spend so much time working on physical activity that you become much more in tune with your body. Now that I type that, I’m also certain that is why. After 400 miles on the road running–most of those alone and many without headphones-you just feel more of your body. How your foot strikes, the tightness in the shoulders, and every little creak and pain from the  ankles to the knees.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I haven’t see any of these shows yet. I started episode 1 of Daredevil but abandoned it because I decided to spend that time on other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest problem with television watching is that I have a hard time sitting still for that long and feeling good about investing my time in sitting and watching something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This comes from my years as a full-time employee with a side business and always feeling like I had to crank away on the side business widgets during any downtime. This changed a bit after becoming a father but you just shift things around to make room for work anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 2016, I am going to try to work a bit more pleasure entertainment (fiction reading and watching) into my schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

In this community, we met Birhanu Zerihun who built an impressive set-up for his natural sundried coffees on his 10 hectares of land—and created a super-juicy coffee with bright notes raspberry and strawberry.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2015/11/15/infinity-wallet---minimalist-and-slim</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the last year I’ve been using a rubber band for my wallet. Not just any rubber band; it was product FN-09 from &lt;a href=&quot;http://fieldnotesbrand.com&quot;&gt;Field Notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lost a credit card after my previous front-pocket wallet’s leather stretched out and required a certain number of cards to work. I searched for a wallet and then my friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/dimambro&quot;&gt;Jason DiMambro&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that he used FN-09. Brilliant idea! So I used it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that rubber band started wearing down after a lot of use and I decided to find a new wallet. I stumbled upon the Infinity Wallet and it is perfect for me. It is durable, thin, and compresses whatever is in it so you can scale your cards up and down, as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day I’ll get to the point of only needing my watch and no wallet at all. But until then I’ll use the Infinity Wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Running & Being by Dr. George Sheehan</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2015/11/15/running-and-being-book-review.html"/>
   
   <updated>2015-11-15T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2015/11/15/running-and-being-book-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A lot of running books seek to motivate through superior examples: “I’ve accomplished a lot, you can, too, by following my advice.” Or “I was once a beginner like you and here’s how I’ve accomplished &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Running &amp;amp; Being&lt;/em&gt; by cardiologist, marathoner, and writer George Sheehan is written in a manner and tone of a doctor with good bedside manners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheehan motivates the reader by turning himself and his thoughts on running inside out. He exposes his weaknesses, thereby making the reader comfortable with hers. It’s the ultimate long run with Sheehan as he digs deep into his head to make sense of running, his body, and his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is legendary and beloved in running circles. The copy I read was the 20th anniversary edition published posthumously with a wonderful note (titled “Family Words”) at the beginning to give new timers like me some perspective on Sheehan and the book. I borrowed my copy from the local library but I plan to purchase as an ongoing reference book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highly recommended for any runner, especially if you’ve had a few long runs where you had to dig deep while questioning it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Running-Being-Experience-George-Sheehan/dp/1623362539/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1447625805&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=running+%26+being&quot;&gt;Buy the book from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Review of the film My Run</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2015/11/12/a-review-of-film-my-run.html"/>
   
   <updated>2015-11-12T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2015/11/12/a-review-of-film-my-run</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since I started running 9 months ago I’ve been curious about others’ running experiences, especially people on the edges: those who are elite and pushing the boundaries in distance and speed, and those who are new to running and doing something amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That drew me to the story of Terry Hitchcock: a widower who lost his wife to cancer, and single father raising three kids. You probably heard his story back in the early 90s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Fox&quot;&gt;Terry Fox&lt;/a&gt;, who ran one-legged across Canada while fighting cancer to raise awareness for cancer research, Terry Hitchcock decided to run across several US states to raise awareness of the challenges facing single parents. A worthy cause for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The documentary &lt;em&gt;My Run&lt;/em&gt; is about Terry Hitchcock’s journey running 75 marathons in 75 days going from Minnesota to Atlanta (just in time for the Olympic Games).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This amazing story and motivation by Terry has the makings of wonderful documentary. After all, it did win festival awards, including at its debut right here in Austin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the film didn’t do Terry’s wonderful story justice. It sold it short through choppy storytelling. There was no real arc to the story, no build up, just a mundane recounting of the timeline of Terry’s epic run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Terry progressed through his 75 days journey, the film was a headwind, holding back any sense of progress, drama, and excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like a such an easy story to tell (to a non-filmmaker like me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the experience of the film itself (in this case the medium is most definitely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the message), I still recommend that you rent, stream, or buy the film and watch it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get beyond the film treatment of the Terry’s story and admire, wince, and worry about someone’s determination to finish a near impossible feat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked up a copy at my local library and that might be your best best, too, for finding the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Syncing Runkeeper and Strava</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2015/09/24/syncing-runkeeper-and-strava.html"/>
   
   <updated>2015-09-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2015/09/24/syncing-runkeeper-and-strava</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using &lt;a href=&quot;http://runkeeper.com&quot;&gt;Runkeeper&lt;/a&gt; since I started running this past February. I chose it based on its reputation and, generally, I really like it. The app is maintained and improved. &lt;a href=&quot;http://ryanirelan.com/2015/09/24/my-one-use-case-for-apple-watch.html&quot;&gt;They even have an Apple Watch app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also like to see my data in other services. &lt;a href=&quot;http://strava.com&quot;&gt;Strava&lt;/a&gt; has a nice website and different approach to displaying training data. I wanted to try it out without switching services or losing some data in a service I might only use once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my surprise both Runkeeper and Strava have good APIs that make moving data between the two very simple…using a service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use a syncing service called &lt;a href=&quot;http://tapiriik.com&quot;&gt;Tapiriik&lt;/a&gt;, which is free for manual syncing or a small sum per year for automatic syncing. I opted for automatic because life’s too short for manual work.  It’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cpfair/tapiriik&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; so you can set it up on your own, too, if you’d like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I approach any  syncing services with caution and suspicion. It’s not that I don’t trust them with my data; I don’t trust that the data will match up in a way that is useful. But the syncing with Tapiriik between Runkeeper and Strava is just about perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I paid for automatic syncing, my Runkeeper run data is on Strava within 20 or 30 minutes of completing my run (Tapiriik syncs every 20 minutes). That is perfect for reviewing my Training Log in Strava (my favorite use of Strava right now is to review my running data in a nicer layout than Runkeeper) when I sit down at my desk in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My One Use for Apple Watch</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2015/09/24/my-one-use-case-for-apple-watch.html"/>
   
   <updated>2015-09-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2015/09/24/my-one-use-case-for-apple-watch</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dan Moren has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://sixcolors.com/post/2015/09/five-months-in-what-i-use-my-apple-watch-for/&quot;&gt;good post over on Six Colors&lt;/a&gt; where he share his main uses for Apple Watch after 5 month of use. I suspect his usage is common among the early adopters who ordered a Watch the day it was available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I want to share my one single use case for Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday–just three days ago–I purchased an Apple Watch. I walked out of the Apple Store shortly before WatchOS 2 was released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me five months to purchase it and I only did because I wanted it for one specific thing: running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed a device that let me glance at my running pace, distance, and time via &lt;a href=&quot;http://runkeeper.com&quot;&gt;Runkeeper&lt;/a&gt;. I used to do this via their audio updates in my headphones. But I stopped running with headphones because &lt;em&gt;a)&lt;/em&gt; they start to hurt after 5 miles or so, and &lt;em&gt;b)&lt;/em&gt; I need a break from noise in my ears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could’ve purchased a specialized running watch, like a Garmin or some other such thing. They’re very functional and they get good reviews. And they don’t require bringing my oversized phone on a run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I detest unitaskers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Apple Watch, after only three runs using it, is &lt;em&gt;nearly&lt;/em&gt; perfect. The Sport model holds up to sweat, it’s quick to activate so I can see the details of my run (there’s a little lag when it calls back to the phone to get the updated data), and, using the Runkeeper app, I can stop and save my workout without pulling out my phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With WatchOS 2 and the availability of heart rate data to third party apps, the appeal of using the watch for running was even greater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t sure I needed an Apple Watch back in the Spring. But now I am. I plan to wear it on every training run and race. Goodbye headphones.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A new version of the great NetNewsWire is out from Black Pixel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ready for a blast from the past? NetNewsWire, the venerable RSS reader, is back, with a release of version 4.0. It launches with both a $10 Mac app and a $4 iOS app, supported by a cloud syncing service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NetNewsWire was the first Mac app I ever purchased. It was 2002-2003, I was in the last year of grad school at UNC and I had recently purchased my first Mac  (a white iBook).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was still relatively new to the modern web design and development world then, and reading blogs and feeds in NetNewsWire is how I kept up with it and learned as much as I could in between school tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds like this version of NNW is fairly different than what Brent originally created but purely out of nostalgia I am glad it’s back.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;John Dickerson has mentioned this enough that I finally picked up the MP3 audiobook from our library after an aborted attempt to read the paper version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest impression coming away from it so far (and I’m &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; six hours in) is that it makes our crazy political times seem fairly normal; it is just a rerun of the shenanigans we’ve seen before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself getting outraged by current political theater then reading some history might help you realize that it isn’t the worst it’s been. In fact, we’ve seen it all before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, not me.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Nation of Renters</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Om Malik:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would rather stay debt free than be beholden to the banks. I am a renter by choice. Others aren’t, thanks to Housing Bubble 2.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t think of anything else I’d rather not do with money right now than buy a house. And that’s especially true in the frothy Austin market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been on the ass end of the housing market so my experience definitely influences my behavior.  I know the real truth about the so-called investment of a house. I’m lucky because I could pay to get out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add up your ongoing costs, maintenance and upgrades to keep the house marketable and it is not the  rosy picture real estate agents and mortgage companies paint when you’re house hunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you approach it as a &lt;em&gt;home&lt;/em&gt; that requires an ongoing, sometimes significant investment of money that you might not get back (but don’t care because you’re trading that money for a &lt;em&gt;home&lt;/em&gt;) than you’ll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise you should consider renting, being debt free, and not beholden to loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a comment on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wolfstreet.com/2015/07/01/home-buying-panic-sets-in-housing-bubble-2-soars-industry-drools-but-its-doomed-says-zillow/&quot;&gt;article that Om linked to&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When I did have a mortgage I remember when I did the last refi at the credit union. I was feeling down about things and asked the loans officer what she thought I was doing wrong? This was around 1990. She said, “are you kidding? Those people up in the new sub-divisons with the boats, trucks, and trailers in the driveways own almost nothing. They owe on everything and if they miss a months work the banks will come and take it all, one toy at a time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of my least favorite sentiments among developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might drive us to do better but is also so easily thrown out as a cheap insult that is &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; ignorant of the actual work behind a tool or technology.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Keeping a Routine with Due</title>
   
   <link href="https://brooksreview.net/2015/07/short-term-memory/"/>

   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2015/07/24/keeping-a-routine-with-due</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ben Brooks shares how Due has helped him remember the small things that are easy to forget or put off day-to-day: like eating lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I figured out three really important things I need to put in there for constant reminders: stopping for lunch, stopping for dinner, and taking the garbage/recycling out the night before. I can’t even tell you how nice this is — and I am not joking around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Due to keep myself on a regular, predictable routine every weekday. I have a Due set up to remind me to leave for the office at 8:30. To break for lunch at 12:30 (even if I don’t &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; hungry). To write in my DayOne journal 10 minutes before the end of my day. And, finally, to leave my office every day at 5pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I’m 100% in charge of my own schedule (no one scheduling meetings for me without my knowledge), I can keep a very structured daily schedule exactly how I want it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I leave and return at the  same times every day. I eat lunch at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This even sounds crazy to me. But it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://mijingo.com&quot;&gt;Mijingo&lt;/a&gt; that pricing products for value is hard. And sometimes it’s a guess. Hell, most of the time it is a guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when you hit it just right, where the value is really there, you have something that no one else does, and the customer is benefiting ten fold from the price paid, it’s magical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the best part of being in online education: teaching topics that the student can go out and turn into their own income or happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Drinking coffee is not a health decision. It’s a comforting ritual, a pick-me-up, or an excuse to chat with friends. Why must we turn everything in our lives (daylight saving time, religiousness, bicycle sharing, comedy) into a health decision?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fiery look at the good/bad coffee studies that always make the world out to be so binary. It turns Americans  into “insufferable bores,” according to the author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just Americans?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to live a life of moderation, with the somewhat blind assumption that not indulging too much in anything (alcohol, heavy and sweet foods, exercise) will serve me well.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Shelby Foote at Home</title>
   
   <link href="http://www.c-span.org/video/?165823-1/depth-shelby-foote"/>
   
   <updated>2015-06-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2015/06/28/shelby-foote-at-home</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been watching the classic &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/civilwar/&quot;&gt;Ken Burns documentary &lt;em&gt;The Civil War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and got sidetracked by the main historian used throughout the series, Shelby Foote. This linked video of a tour of his work area in his home in Memphis has quite a few gems from Foote. It’s nearly universal that we all like to see how writers work, and this interview is not a disappointment. This interview was recorded about 5 years before Foote died in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting fact: Foote was a last minute addition to the Burns documentary but became a core part of the series in the final edit. He also became a sensation from his witty facts and stories (well, as much as a sensation as you can become from being in a Ken Burns documentary).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sales of Foote’s fiction and non-fiction books, especially his three-part series on the Civil War, took off after his appearance in the documentary, making him a nice bag of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;His three-part narrative had sold around 30,000 copies since the first volume came out in 1958; in the year after Foote appeared in The Civil War, he’d sold 400,000 sets. “Ken,” he told the director, “you’ve made me a millionaire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first 30-40 minutes of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.c-span.org/video/?165823-1/depth-shelby-foote&quot;&gt;three hour segement&lt;/a&gt; are worth watching but all of it is a wonderful look at Foote and his work.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>It's a big black monolith.</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2015/06/25/kubrick-ebert-2001.html"/>
   
   <updated>2015-06-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2015/06/25/kubrick-ebert-2001</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This past Monday, I went to see Kubrick’s &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; on 70mm at the downtown location of the Alamo Drafthouse here in Austin.  I had never seen &lt;em&gt;2001&lt;/em&gt; on the big screen before, so I was looking forward to that. Seeing a 70mm print of the film made it extra special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theater was nearly full (minus the cheap seats up front) and it was an enjoyable experience despite a damaged audio track on the film that caused a faint, but noticeable, clicking sounds off to the left side. The clicking sound must’ve caused problems in previous showings because a Drafthouse employee took to the stage before the film began to offer full refunds to anyone who was bothered by the noise. I’m curious if anyone took him up on the offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; has many uncomfortable moments–both visually and audibly–and it has always creeped me out a bit. I enjoy watching it but it leaves me feeling unsettled (as it should, I suppose). Watching the film on a big screen with loud audio made only intensified my experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently watched &lt;em&gt;Life Itself&lt;/em&gt;, the documentary about Roger Ebert. With his work on my mind, I dug up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/2001-the-monolith-and-the-message&quot;&gt;his review of &lt;em&gt;2001&lt;/em&gt; from 1968&lt;/a&gt;, the same year the film was released. This review is classic Ebert; it was full of spunk, sarcasm, and wit. I can’t resist sharing some quotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the film confused so many people (even Rock Hudson during the premiere, according to Ebert) and caused conversation &lt;em&gt;during&lt;/em&gt; the movie to understand what it was about (this would get you booted from an Alamo Drafthouse today), Ebert quipped out of frustration right at the top of his review:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If people do not have the courtesy to shut up during a film, they should at least be segregated into special Saturday kiddie matinees, no matter how advanced their years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I take issue with this. My 4 year-old is exceptionally quiet and attentive in the movie theater.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then the questions about the monolith:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Q. What’s that big black monolith? 
A. It’s a big black monolith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Q. Where did it come from? 
A. From somewhere else.
Q. Who put it there?
 A. Intelligent beings since it has right angles and nature doesn’t make right angles on its own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, finally:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Man is a curious animal. He is uneasy in the face of great experiences, and if he is forced to experience something profound, he starts immediately to cheapen it, to bring it down to his own level. Thus after a great man is assassinated, lesser men immediately manufacture, buy and sell plastic statues and souvenir billfolds and lucky coins with the great man’s image on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a great review and pure Ebert. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/2001-the-monolith-and-the-message&quot;&gt;Read the whole thing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;[…] Arizona’s second-largest utility, the Salt River Project, imposed charges of some fifty dollars a month on the average new solar installation. S.R.P. also insists that it is “pro-solar,” but the new charges effectively make it economically difficult for homeowners in the company’s service district—in the sunniest state in the country, and in a city that roots for the Phoenix Suns—to install solar panels. Rooftop installations, booming six months ago, have all but halted…&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Astronauts Don't Eat Freeze Dried Ice Cream</title>

   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2015/06/18/astronauts-dont-eat-ice-cream</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some heartbreaking truth for legions of adults who grew up in the 80s: astronauts don’t actually eat that awful freeze-dried ice cream. We all pretended to like it when visiting Kennedy Space Center as kids or buying it in a science store at a local museum but it’s okay: astronauts don’t like it either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So why no freeze-dried astronaut ice cream? “We don’t fly it,” Kloeris says. “If our crew members wanted to put it in their preference containers, they could; it certainly has a long enough shelf life. It meets all the requirements, but we don’t have any requests. It’s not like real ice cream, it’s more like hard cotton candy. And it wouldn’t be easy to eat in microgravity because it’s very crumbly, so it would make a huge mess.”&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been speaking German since 1998 with varying amounts of fluency. My language skills were in top shape in the late 90s and early 00s when I was living in Germany and then studying German as an undergrad and graduate student back here in the States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But over the last several years my skills have atrophied. When you’re fluent in an language as an adult, you don’t ever lose the language completely. But your sharpness with it, especially idiomatic language, starts to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than listening to my wife and daughter speak everyday (we are raising her bi-lingual), I don’t have much other interaction with the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This podcast is pretty basic stuff for someone who knows the language but I enjoy it because it deals with daily life language usage. When you are fluent but don’t use the language regularly the expressions of daily life are the first things to go.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Making the Craft Feature Videos</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/craftcms,/video/production,/mijingo,/consulting/2015/05/07/making-the-craft-feature-videos.html"/>
   
   <updated>2015-05-07T21:45:15-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/craftcms,/video/production,/mijingo,/consulting/2015/05/07/making-the-craft-feature-videos</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&quot;http://ryanirelan.com/articles/saying-goodbye-to-happy-cog/&quot;&gt;going indie back at the end of June 2014&lt;/a&gt;, one of the consulting projects I worked on is a series of videos covering major features of &lt;a href=&quot;http://buildwithcraft.com&quot;&gt;Craft, a CMS from Pixel &amp;amp; Tonic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s one on &lt;a href=&quot;https://buildwithcraft.com/features/entry-types&quot;&gt;Craft’s Entry Types&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;//player.vimeo.com/video/109747221?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;color=ff9933&quot; width=&quot;920&quot; height=&quot;518&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video production process was much different than what I do to create my &lt;a href=&quot;https://mijingo.com&quot;&gt;video courses at Mijingo&lt;/a&gt;. I took a Craft feature that Brandon Kelly at Pixel &amp;amp; Tonic wants covered and figure out a way to distill it down to 59 seconds (actually a little less because of the music lead-in and the closing graphic). It has to be clear yet compact. It can’t be too detailed because 59 seconds&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fiftynineseconds&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fiftynineseconds&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; isn’t enough time; but there has to be &lt;em&gt;just enough&lt;/em&gt; detail to demonstrate the feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took us more than a few tries to find a process and formula that works. But when we did, the remaining videos were a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pre-production&quot;&gt;Pre-Production&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each video, my process started by reviewing the current feature page on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://buildwithcraft.com&quot;&gt;Craft website&lt;/a&gt; so I could understand how Brandon was marketing the feature. I jotted down some notes so I could try to use the same language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some of the videos I had a Skype call or chat with Brandon to hear thoughts and talk through some treatment ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I wrote out the “Problem” and the “Solution.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The videos start identifying the problem, then mention the solution, and only afterward show the solution in a (very) mini tutorial. For my prep, I listed out the steps of the video, with brief notes about the script and action on screen.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:paperbased&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:paperbased&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/craft-videos-notes.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Photograph of notes and storyboard for Craft video&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I knew my approach and the general sequence of how I’ll cover the feature over 59 seconds, I started writing a script in Google Docs. After I completed a solid draft, I created a Final Cut Pro X project and recorded the voiceover over the music. Using the music right away helps me tweak the script so its pacing and syncopation fits with the music, and to discover and toss out words and phrases that sound terrible when spoken aloud. Reading the script aloud will always make wordy sentences and repeated words more noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the script draft done and the voiceover test recording done, I shared both with Brandon for his feedback and edits. He owns the voice of Craft, so it was important that the script is consistent with the website copy and how he thinks the features should be described. He’s also great at giving the script some clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I quickly and crudely sketched a storyboard showing the different scenes. This helped me figure out what I (or someone else) needed to prepare for the sample site and film. We were working with the same sample project (&lt;a href=&quot;http://pixelandtonic.com/blog/meet-happy-lager-crafts-new-demo-site&quot;&gt;Happy Lager&lt;/a&gt;) for each video and I build my examples around what’s available in the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;production&quot;&gt;Production&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production process started with reviewing the storyboard. I took stock of the “scenes” and “shots” (they’re all screen-based so it feels weird to call them scenes or shots). I reviewed everything to see if I don’t have the assets (something designed in the sample site or code) to pull off the shots. Once I’m sure I do, I proceed with “filming.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had animations to do, I’d work on that first in Apple Motion. The animations aren’t complex but it did require pulling in current screenshots (or PSD exports) of the sample site and creating the different views (typically a one-up, two-up, or three-up of the sample site pages we’ll talk about). I’ve found that if I have to do a lot of scrolling of a web page, the best way to get smooth scrolling is to it in Apple Motion or as an animation inside of Final Cut Pro X. Trying to do smooth scrolling by hand is a feat not worth the time. Plus, I like to drink coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filming took place with my screen resolution set down to 1920x1080 and everything is full screen or maximized. I use Screenflow for capturing the screen video and save it out as a lossless file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the interactions (filling out a form, selecting a drop-down) were recorded at least three times, sometimes more if I wasn’t able to get it right. What’s right? I want it to look natural but crisp and with intent. Wishy-washy mousing and interactions make for a weaker video. You can’t edit that in to the video (oh, I’ve tried) so you want to get it right during capture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the animations and screen recordings were done, I moved to post-production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;post-production&quot;&gt;Post-Production&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step of post-production was to re-record the voiceover. Depending on the script, timing, and sometimes how I felt, this can take 3 takes or 30 takes. I’ve done as many as 40 but I’m better at it after a lot of practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the voiceover in place, I then edited against it. You need one constant while producing videos like this. Choose audio or video. I hope you choose audio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I exported the Screenflow documents and then import them all into Final Cut Pro X. One by one I dropped them in to assemble a rough edit. I wanted to see if I’m missing any clips I actually need or identify any pacing or ordering problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;export--publish&quot;&gt;Export &amp;amp; Publish&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I exported final video right from Final Cut up to Vimeo (via the handy export option) and then sent it off to Brandon Kelly for approval. After he approved the video, I then published it up to the Pixel &amp;amp; Tonic account for embedding on their website.&lt;/p&gt;

The entire race I listened to part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startupstoriespodcast.com/podcast/the-complete-saga/&quot;&gt;Launch. A Startup Documentary&lt;/a&gt; podcast. It’s the story of building and launching &lt;a href=&quot;http://getdrip.com&quot;&gt;Drip&lt;/a&gt;, a bootstrapped lead generation/conversion email marketing tool by Rob Walling and team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All through my 3x weekly training runs for the last 10 weeks, I listened to podcasts or audiobooks while I ran. I found they soothed me and helped distract me early on when the running was particularly hard.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;David J. Loehr over on Jason Snell’s Six Colors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One thing I really like about Sling: Say you put on Food Network and they’re in the middle of wall-to-wall Fieri3. You can scroll backward through the schedule and watch several days’ worth of shows on demand, or time shift the entire schedule, pretend you’re on Pacific time, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of ESPN in these “cord cutter” packages is very tempting. It’s still what I miss the most after not having cable television for the last three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One huge benefit of no cable television is that we don’t feel compelled to have the television on at all. It’s the secondary or tertiary device now, with laptops being first, and iPhones and iPads in a close second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I’m watching House of Cards on my iPhone 6 Plus as I type this.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Middle class neighborhoods are going away:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The fact that the rich have walled themselves off is also troublesome, however. By self-segregating, wealthy families pool their resources in just a handful of communities. At the same time, they’re less likely to know middle-class neighbors and may be less likely to care about what’s happening in less fortunate corners of their city or town. As Bischoff and Reardon note, the more the rich keep to their own, the less reason they have to worry about public schools or parks for someone else’s kids.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Kalanithi to his infant daughter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When you come to one of the many moments in life when you must give an account of yourself, provide a ledger of what you have been, and done, and meant to the world, do not, I pray, discount that you filled a dying man’s days with a sated joy, a joy unknown to me in all my prior years, a joy that does not hunger for more and more, but rests, satisfied. In this time, right now, that is an enormous thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul was a Stanford neurosurgeon that died on March 9, 2015 of non-small-cell EGFR-positive lung cancer. He was 37, his daughter is 8 months old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also wrote about being a doctor and patient &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/25/opinion/sunday/how-long-have-i-got-left.html?_r=0&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://stanmed.stanford.edu/2015spring/before-i-go.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A New Mijingo</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2015/02/23/a-new-mijingo.html"/>
   
   <updated>2015-02-23T22:27:43-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2015/02/23/a-new-mijingo</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the last several months I’ve been working with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.andrewlohman.com&quot;&gt;AJ Lohman&lt;/a&gt; to modernize the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mijingo.com&quot;&gt;Mijingo website’s&lt;/a&gt; design and code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I deployed the new site to the production server. Here’s a video I made to cover what Mijingo is all about and highlight some features of the new site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/zopphyp3au&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; class=&quot;wistia_embed&quot; name=&quot;wistia_embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; oallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; msallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;506&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;//fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js&quot; async=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, AJ and I worked on modernizing the look of Mijingo. I didn’t want it to be too trendy (although the full bleed image is something I ended up asking for) and lose the ability to effectively server my customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had two specific (perhaps obvious) goals in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;make a better impression on new visitors when they came to check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mijingo.com/products&quot;&gt;course library at Mijingo&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;improve the experience for customers &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; they make a purchase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous site did the best it could but it was old. The design was outdated–hastily retrofitted to be responsive–and the code well beyond its prime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We settled on a simple look. The focus was on the new course covers that AJ created using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.typography.com/fonts/whitney/overview/&quot;&gt;Whitney typeface from Hoefler &amp;amp; Co&lt;/a&gt; and some custom shapes and color palate he worked up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/mijingo-course-library.png&quot; alt=&quot;Course Library on Mijingo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see that on the &lt;a href=&quot;https:/mijingo.com/products&quot;&gt;Course Library&lt;/a&gt; with its “cover mode” listing of the products. The courses are color coded based on track: Design is red, Development is green, and CMS/Publishing is a purple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The images are also large and beautiful. Why? Because we used &lt;a href=&quot;https://mijingo.com/products/screencasts/svg-tutorial&quot;&gt;SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics&lt;/a&gt; to display all of the cover art. No large bitmap images to load and the covers look gorgeous on all displays: big, small, retina or standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second improvement–the logged-in experience for customers–was addressed by redoing how customers access their purchased courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous version of Mijingo.com provided the customer with a simple table that listed all of their courses, the videos in those courses, and links to stream the video on the site or download it to their computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most customers chose the download option because the streaming option wasn’t ideal. For the new Mijingo site I really wanted to improve how customers can watch purchased courses right on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned the table listing of purchased courses into a simple, elegant grid of covers. There’s no copy or information about the course other than what is contained in the cover art. Why repeat what’s already there. Plus, the customer has already purchased the course so they’re probably familiar with what they have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/mijingo-my-course-library.png&quot; alt=&quot;Mijingo's My Course Library&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clicking on a cover brings you to a one of the following pages, depending on the course:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A table listing the course videos, with links to stream or download&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The course video, ready to play (if there was only one video in the course)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A table listing the courses and their videos (for a bundle of courses)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This design is a first pass and definitely not final. I want to keep how customers access their courses as simple as possible so I started with an table approach that gets right to the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One change from before is that I broke out the downloadable course materials into a sidebar so they’d sit alongside the videos, even while watching the course. The course materials should be accessible at all times while watching the course not just when you are choosing which video to stream or download.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/mijingo-svg-course-logged-in.png&quot; alt=&quot;Watching the SVG Course&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These aren’t final implementations but small steps (or giant compared to the old site) in improving the experience of watching a course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have some more work to do–we have dozens of fixes and tweaks we’re tracking for the next deployment–including creating guide pages (pulling blog posts, tutorials, and videos into one page) for each major technology, and improving the performance of the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m proud of the update and it’s a solid foundation on which I can build. I hope you’ll check it out and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mijingo.com&quot;&gt;learn something new with Mijingo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week I released a brand new course over at Mijingo that covers &lt;a href=&quot;https://mijingo.com/products/screencasts/intermediate-git-tutorial/&quot;&gt;intermediate Git&lt;/a&gt; usage. The course is 3 modules and several videos and is aimed at helping you go from a normal Git user (git-add, git-commit, etc) to someone with some power moves like git-bisect, git-revert, and customizing the output of the git log.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/muixry3mp4&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; class=&quot;wistia_embed&quot; name=&quot;wistia_embed&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; oallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; msallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;506&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;//fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js&quot; async=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course is 114 minutes long and includes a free, written course workbook, slides, and a long list of additional resources for you to use.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Professional by Steven Pressfield</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2015/02/23/the-professional-by-steven-pressfield.html"/>
   
   <updated>2015-02-23T18:39:39-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2015/02/23/the-professional-by-steven-pressfield</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What I love about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stevenpressfield.com/the-war-of-art/&quot;&gt;Steven Pressfield’s The War of Art&lt;/a&gt; is that he preemptively calls out the people who over-glorify his own book:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The professional is acutely aware of the intangibles that go into inspiration. Out of respect for them, she lets them work. She grants them their sphere while she concentrates on hers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The sign of the amateur is overglorification of and preccopuation with the mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The professional shuts up. She doesn’t talk about it. She does her work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=sR3hAAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA78&amp;amp;lpg=PA78&amp;amp;dq=She+grants+them+their+sphere+while+she+concentrates+on+hers.&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=L3anoAwlnT&amp;amp;sig=_yipUybC_-ChfhbV-DHwQW1dvvM&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=6sjrVNW_MZL7yAS764GYDg&amp;amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=She%20grants%20them%20their%20sphere%20while%20she%20concentrates%20on%20hers.&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The War of Art, p. 78&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He calls out everyone who is on some quest to solve the mystery of getting things done, producing work or shipping. He calls out &lt;em&gt;the entire&lt;/em&gt; cottage industry of you-can-do-its. And, yet, the book is one the canonical texts used to support it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One of the things that we tell the guys is that you have to do more than what is required. At some point in your career whether it is high school, college, or the NBA, you’re going to be at a level where every guy can do the same things that you can do. So what is going to differentiate yourself between you and the other guy that is just as talented is your willingness everyday to work on your fundamentals and your craft, before and after practice.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The best, most practical, and helpful travel gadget or tool I’ve purchased is the Eagle Creek Pack-it Garment Folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can have the cheapest suitcase, a duffle bag, or no suitcase at all (I’ve tossed it in my shoulder bag overnight trips), and this garment folder will keep your shirts crisp and unwrinkled. Nicely ironed shirts matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iron (or dry clean) your shirts beforehand, fold them using the included folding card, and then pack. Once you arrive at your destination, unpack your shirts and hang them up. Putting your shirt of the day in the bathroom while you shower is just enough to steam out the creases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve purchased a lot of silly travel gear and bags over the years. But nothing, absolutely nothing, is as important to me when traveling as this garment folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re wonderful to look at, look great in photos, fairly simple to decorate nooks and seating areas (an interior designer’s dream), and less expensive to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they are a burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no privacy at all. You and your actions are on display from 9 to 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illness travels fast in the open air, and there are constant interruptions–even unintentional like someone just walking by that cause a momentary loss of focus as you catch a glimpse of movement in your peripheral vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, like me, you’re of the easily distracted variety, you work very hard to get focused. You’ve probably created all sort of tricks and hacks to get and stay focused. For us, an open office and its distractions can create a frustrating work day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am an introvert who can be extroverted in certain situations. Like many others, I’m well-adapted to living this contradiction. However, my energy depletes quickly when I always have to be “on” and around people. This includes being in an open office every hour of every work day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can sometimes manage with headphones (noise canceling seem to work the best). But when I can’t, I have to find a small, quiet place to recharge. And there’s no better place than a car. It’s a small space, wonderfully sound proofed (cars make great recording environments), and feels safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, I’ve often eaten lunch and then gone to my car, got in, closed the door, and then just sat in the small cocoon of privacy. There was a sense of relief as I closed the door. I’d then put on some music or a podcast and recharge my mental energy to get through the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open offices also assume we sit at a desk while doing our best work. I certainly don’t. My best work is done while standing, pacing, walking, mumbling to myself while I talk through a problem, and other office culture taboos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this is a problem if I’m in a private space where I can work in a way that works for me. That’s why I’ve been so much more productive and happier in the years that I’ve either worked at home or in an office with a door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I get it: we can’t build offices and work environments that are perfect for everyone. And they certainly can’t cater to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people love and thrive in open offices (a rare species?), others, like me, have to implement coping mechanisms to stay productive and happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we do continue the open office trend, we should try to create closed, private spaces that someone can duck into for an hour of working alone, or just to sit and recharge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bet even the extroverts will like it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://unicornfree.com/2015/a-meditation-on-goals&quot;&gt;Like others&lt;/a&gt;, I had lofty goals for 2014–especially the second half of the year–and I didn’t meet them all. I got down on myself about that because I had only measured one thing and then deemed &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; a failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until I looked a little deeper (basically, I opened up Google Analytics and segmented the data).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while I missed my big lofty goal that I had written on an index card taped my desk the last six months, I actually moved the needle considerably in some very non-flashy areas–but stuff that really matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effort that I put in on marketing, writing, writing more, writing even more, and publishing made a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you’re determined enough, you can find the data and slice it up just right to show that you failed.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>PACE book by YNAB founder</title>
   
   <link href="http://pacehq.com"/>
   
   <updated>2014-12-03T19:11:38-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2014/12/03/pace-book-by-ynab-founder</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Jesse Mecham founded You Need a Budget (YNAB), a software application that helps you track what you spend and keep you and your finances honest with each other. But YNAB isn’t just a piece of software, it’s an approach and way of thinking about your money. And, it applies more to people who make above average incomes where overspending is a well-greased wheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesse took what he learned from YNAB and wrote a book that covers the same approach but for businesses. PACE stands for Prioritize (cash on hand), Anticipate (big expenses), Change (as needed), Establish (a buffer of cash).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you think you know everything about business finances, you should read this book. It’s not a scheme, it’s a plain and simple way of thinking about your revenue and expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Blogs are — or at least were — different. They are an individual’s place for speaking out loud, but the relationships that form around them were based on links among posts, not social networks that link among people. I’m all for social networks, but we also need networks of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Things I Like: Podcasts</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2014/11/07/things-i-like-podcasts.html"/>
   
   <updated>2014-11-07T14:48:43-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2014/11/07/things-i-like-podcasts</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have a weird history with podcasts. I was “part of” the first wave of podcasting back in the mid 2000s. I went to the podcast conferences, unconferences, and other gatherings. I co-wrote a book on podcasting, I ran a podcasting website (with very little success!), and I had a couple of my own podcasts. The first one I had was a  weird mix of music and stories. Then I did a podcast on ExpressionEngine, with Dan Benjamin as my co-host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I got out of podcasting when my agency work took over and I started writing and recording screencasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now it’s, like, &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, anyway, I like podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a wonderful medium that is easy to enter as a content producer. It’s only slightly easier to enter today as it was in 2005 but still pretty easy to turn on a mic and talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Podcasting highlights voices and ideas that you’d never otherwise hear. It brings attention to topics and opinions you would miss because not everyone has the time or inclination to write it down and post online to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Podcasting is great because it captures what we all do best: talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of my Things I Like series (of which this is the first post), here are my favorite podcasts. I post these to show gratitude to the people who create them, and the stories they cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/systematic&quot;&gt;Systematic&lt;/a&gt; - Brett Terpstra’s weekly show where he talks to interesting people and technology. Brett is routinely giving a platform to people who are outside of the normal Apple/podcasting/tech circles. Listen to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/systematic/111&quot;&gt;episode with his wife and her animal rescue work&lt;/a&gt;, the one &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/systematic/97&quot;&gt;sub-zero bartending&lt;/a&gt;, or the show with &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/systematic/104&quot;&gt;veterinarian who works at a turtle conservancy&lt;/a&gt;, or the most recent show (as of this writing) about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/systematic/121&quot;&gt;challenges of software development for medical devices&lt;/a&gt;. They all gravitate to technology at some point but the stories and people are interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://serialpodcast.org/&quot;&gt;Serial&lt;/a&gt; - From This American Life, it’s a weekly series about a Baltimore murder case. This podcast is addictive and, like This American Life, really well done. It’s becoming a bit of an online sensation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/gabfest.html&quot;&gt;Slate’s Political Gabfest&lt;/a&gt; - I don’t listen to any other political podcasts and I prefer not to read a lot on politics. But this podcast is good. Two of the hosts are working journalists with beats and they are calm in their opinions. It’s an enjoyable way to hear about the bullshit that is our American political existence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.codepen.io/radio/&quot;&gt;CodePen Radio&lt;/a&gt; - The podcast by the three guys behind CodePen. Each episode is a new topic on their experience building a web app and a business. An honest take on what they’ve learned, what they do and don’t know, and how they work. It’s not pushy “do it like us” business talk. I like that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/amicus.html&quot;&gt;Slate’s Amicus&lt;/a&gt; - I tweeted about this new podcast recently. Dahlia Lithwick has guests on about Supreme Court cases for conversation deep enough to be informative but not so deep that only law geeks would understand. She also edits in recorded audio from the court proceedings so you can hear the justices give their rulings.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://99percentinvisible.org/&quot;&gt;99% Invisible&lt;/a&gt; - The darling podcast of the last couple years. This is a successful indie spin-off from public radio and always, &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; a great listen. It is presumably about architecture and design but it appeals to everyone. Interesting fact: Roman Mars said his close mic technique (you can almost hear the saliva smacking around in his mouth) is on purpose to give a more intimate feel to the show.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Thursday is the Only Holiday</title>

   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2014/11/06/thursday-is-the-greatest-holiday</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two songs for Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one is from &lt;a href=&quot;http://thefeatures.com&quot;&gt;The Features&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve known this band (and two of the original members still in the band) for almost 20 years. They were in the college dormitory next to mine. Later, after we all dropped out of college, I did FOH sound for them for a while. I met my wife while working one of their shows. I traveled with them to SXSW 1997 (I think they opened for Spoon), did some road gigs, and spent time recording in Jackson, MS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of their classic songs–and one recorded during that stay in Mississippi–is “Thursday.” Back in the day they closed shows with a raucous version of this song. When I saw them last week here in Austin they closed with it again. Never gets old, always great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ever wonder why Thursday is my favorite day, this is why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;//player.vimeo.com/video/7384279?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;color=ff9933&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a song with which, I’m sure, you are much more familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Behind Learning SVG</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2014/11/05/learn-svg.html"/>
   
   <updated>2014-11-05T16:48:24-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2014/11/05/learn-svg</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago I released a new course, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mijingo.com/products/screencasts/svg-tutorial/&quot;&gt;Up and Running with SVG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, over at Mijingo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also did something for the first time: I put together a &lt;a href=&quot;http://svgtutorial.com&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; with a lot of the course material and made it free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://svgtutorial.com&quot;&gt;SVGTutorial.com&lt;/a&gt;, the website that accompanies the video course, has a lot of the content that is in the course but in written form. On each page, I politely ask people who get value from the content to purchase the full course so they can get everything and the better experience of watching the video. And, of course, support me and my work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating the website wasn’t a lot of extra work. It only took a few hours–mostly to tweak the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/TheChymera/Koenigspress&quot;&gt;Octopress theme&lt;/a&gt; I am using–to go from nothing to a published site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While researching and preparing to record &lt;em&gt;Up and Running with SVG&lt;/em&gt;, I wrote out the entire course in a Markdown document, including code examples. This is a new way I’ve begun preparing courses because I’ve found that writing it all down helps me better structure and evaluate the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a nice byproduct I get written content that I can then use on a website or to include with the course as a PDF handbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since all of the writing was already in Markdown–and I use Markdown for the website–I only had to copy content from one document and paste it in another. Fast and simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting the site together was a lot of fun and I’m planning to do the same for some other courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the process of writing out the entire course longform (as opposed to just a detailed outline like I used to do), I have re-discovered the joy I get from teaching with my writing. It’s something I enjoyed so much back in the late aughts when I wrote my &lt;a href=&quot;https://pragprog.com/book/riexen/expressionengine-2&quot;&gt;ExpressionEngine book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the teaser for the course:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Keeping Our Experiences</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/writing,/content,/archiving/2014/10/09/keeping-our-content.html"/>
   
   <updated>2014-10-09T15:17:47-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/writing,/content,/archiving/2014/10/09/keeping-our-content</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every morning I launch an app called &lt;a href=&quot;http://timehop.com/&quot;&gt;Timehop&lt;/a&gt;. It shows me stuff that I’ve posted to social media over the last seven years or so. It is the only reliable and simple way I can get a glimpse of my activities, thoughts, and photos, from today three years ago or today seven years ago (a sad reality for many of us, I’m afraid). Because social media services like Facebook and Twitter make it so difficult to explore your past &lt;em&gt;contributions to their networks&lt;/em&gt;, services like Timehop have become required to really collect our thoughts that we willingly spread across all these different services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.manton.org/2014/10/the-unremarkable-yesterday.html&quot;&gt;Manton Reece recently posted&lt;/a&gt; that we should consider not spreading our content around all these different services and then have our content “sliced up and interspersed with ads on someone else’s platform.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manton notes that these common every day activities that we so casually document on social media services is, in essence, our life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Those common everyday activities that don’t seem noteworthy today? That’s our life. One after another, strung together for days and then years until we die. It’s the culture of the 21st century scattered among millions of micro posts. And it’ll be lost to time if we don’t curate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a digital scrapbook. It is our digital journal. If you’re like me and don’t have a history of journaling, the online services are where we keep notes about our lives, our experiences, and even our fears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, I quipped on Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Delete Twitter app from your phone. 2. Install &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dayone&quot;&gt;@dayone&lt;/a&gt;. 3. Have urge to post to Twitter? Launch DayOne and write a journal entry instead.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ryan Irelan (@ryanirelan) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ryanirelan/status/508001951624093697&quot;&gt;September 5, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tweet came out of reacquainting myself with &lt;a href=&quot;http://dayoneapp.com&quot;&gt;DayOne&lt;/a&gt;, which is an app that allows you to diary or journal your day-to-day activities. I purchased DayOne for OS X and iOS a while ago. But I wasn’t actually using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at Timehop one morning I realized that my information is strewn about all over the place. I decided to centralize. I wanted it in a futureproof format that allowed me to easily archive it, search it, retrieve it, reformat it, or do whatever I wanted to it at any time I wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opposite of what Twitter or Facebook offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set up DayOne with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://brettterpstra.com/projects/slogger/&quot;&gt;tool by Brett Terpstra called Slogger&lt;/a&gt;. Slogger automatically slurps up all of my social media data and stores it in DayOne. Whatever I post on social services is safely saved in my journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also needed a behavior change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DayOne is now a main app on both my laptop and my iPhone. On my phone I put it in the place where the Twitter app used to be, so that it is what I launched when I have a thought to record or a smart-ass comment to make. DayOne makes it really easy to share your diary entries out to the social services, so why not have it there to begin with?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still sharing on social services like Twitter, but now I’m maintaining control of what I write because everything is always either sourced from or archived to DayOne. For me, this means perhaps one day collecting all of this information from my journal and giving it to my family as a record of the experiences I had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thoughts you have, the moments you experience, the photos you take, the videos you record, put together is–as Manton points out–your life_. While I am not a very sentimental person, we learn from our own past. We have the technology to document it on our own terms. It is important that we do so.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you’re a CEO, the most important thing is to pick people around you that aren’t like you–that compliment you–because you want to build a puzzle; you don’t want to stack chiclets up and have everyone be the same.

   <title>60 Days Mijingo Check-in</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/mijingo,/self-employment/2014/09/07/60-days-mijingo-check-in.html"/>
   
   <updated>2014-09-07T19:04:38-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/mijingo,/self-employment/2014/09/07/60-days-mijingo-check-in</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s been a bit more than two full calendar months since I left my position at Happy Cog and went out on my own to focus on &lt;a href=&quot;https://mijingo.com&quot;&gt;Mijingo&lt;/a&gt; and see where I can take the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most days over the last two months I’ve filled with two martini business lunches (three &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be excessive), single origin espressos to fuel the afternoon grind, and late night caviar dinners followed by a single barrel nightcap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lift-off&quot;&gt;Lift Off&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing like that all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working for myself has been almost exactly what I thought it would be. Long days, some nights, and a lot of simple, hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going indie was described to me by one person as a freefall;  you don’t really know what will work when you first start, so you just try stuff and see how it goes (hoping to land on your feet). Someone else instructed me to not freak out if the money takes some time to catch up with the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both are true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-work&quot;&gt;It’s Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of what I’ve done isn’t even public yet. I’ve revamped a couple courses, created a brand new course (&lt;a href=&quot;https://mijingo.com/products/screencasts/javascript-task-runners-grunt-gulp/&quot;&gt;JavaScript Task Runners&lt;/a&gt;), worked on some marketing videos (&lt;a href=&quot;http://buildwithcraft.com/features/matrix&quot;&gt;here’s one&lt;/a&gt;), did some consulting (with more to come), and quite a bit of back-end work on Mijingo.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fixed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mijingo.com/account&quot;&gt;account page where you access your course library&lt;/a&gt;. It’s now much easier to see what you purchased (but far from perfect), and the code behind it makes more sense and doesn’t have quick-fix conditionals with hardcoded values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is now more robust support for course bundles. I have already published two of those: &lt;a href=&quot;https://mijingo.com/products/bundles/cms-course-bundle/&quot;&gt;CMS Learning Pack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mijingo.com/products/bundles/expressionengine-training-courses/&quot;&gt;ExpressionEngine Mastery&lt;/a&gt;. Bundles are just products that are collections of other products. Not very difficult to do within ExpressionEngine but, like most things, I just needed the time to do it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also spent a lot of time thinking about ways of giving my students more with each course. For example, there are some free additional resources that I’m adding to the courses. I’m also experimenting with taking my research and notes from the course prep and turning it into an ebook for students. I just did that for my &lt;a href=&quot;https://mijingo.com/blog/just-added-javascript-task-runners-ebook&quot;&gt;JavaScript Task Runners course&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do this because I want the experience with Mijingo courses to be so good that it’s the first place web designer and developers go when it’s time to learn something new. For me, this means over-delivering and making it easy to learn again with Mijingo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;choosing-what-to-do&quot;&gt;Choosing What to Do&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the ever-present, nagging, dull pain of the two months has been the constant worry that I’m working on the wrong thing at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These thoughts run through my head:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I should be spending my time creating that course instead of improving my email marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I should spend more time fixing the website design instead of take an hour to just sit and think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I should be spending my time editing that course instead of recording a podcast episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clear idea of what my short term goals are has helped a lot. I work only on stuff that brings me closer to meeting the goals. Obvious stuff when I think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have two goals right now and each is written on an index card. The cards are taped to my desk. I look at them every day and now I’m better about knowing whether what I’m doing is the right thing, right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Complaining is a sign that someone isn’t willing to risk moving on a changeable situation, or won’t consider the immutable circumstance in his or her plans. This is temporary and hollow form of self-validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Preamble to a Guest Blog Post</title>

   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2014/08/28/preamble-to-a-guest-blog-post</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ellislab.com/blog/entry/mijingo-a-funny-name-but-a-serious-way-to-learn-expressionengine&quot;&gt;guest blog post for EllisLab&lt;/a&gt; about my Mijingo courses on ExpressionEngine. Here’s the introduction that I cut from the guest post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost 20 years ago I landed in Germany on a one-way ticket with two duffle bags stuffed with almost everything I owned. I didn’t speak the language, I didn’t know anyone except a few people. I was a college drop-out and I didn’t have a job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned German through an intensive, immersive course that used real world contexts and scenarios. There was no rote memorization of words or verb conjugations. I learned as I acted out daily life scenarios, like buying groceries, asking the bus driver for help, or going to the doctor because of an illness. It’s the kind of stuff that would be critical to know once I left the comfortable confines of the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I became fluent in German in less than a year because this was such an effective teaching approach. It stuck with me. As a graduate student, I later taught students German using the same methodology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I don’t teach foreign languages anymore but I do teach people how to use the tools that help them build the web. My students learn through these same principles in my courses at &lt;a href=&quot;https://mijingo.com&quot;&gt;Mijingo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Merchant Account vs. Stripe</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/ecommerce,/payments,/stripe,/authorize.net/2014/07/17/merchant-account-vs-stripe.html"/>
   
   <updated>2014-07-17T21:55:48-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/ecommerce,/payments,/stripe,/authorize.net/2014/07/17/merchant-account-vs-stripe</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The history of selling at &lt;a href=&quot;http://mijingo.com&quot;&gt;Mijingo&lt;/a&gt; has been a progression toward bringing it all closer to home. I started selling training materials with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://pragprog.com&quot;&gt;publisher&lt;/a&gt;. Two years later, I switched to a hosted selling platform that handled the cart, and all aspects of order management. Two more years later, I moved to running the store right inside of my website CMS, and created a merchant account with my bank using Authorize.net as my gateway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of six years I’ve removed some middle people and a lot of the cost. I gained more control over all aspects of selling (including checkout funnel tracking), money from sales hit my business account faster, and fees decreased significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I keep thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://stripe.com&quot;&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt;, its modern API, and its wide support among so many e-commerce tools. Authorize.net is an old hog of a service; their website and tools are sorely in need of an update (I dread having to log in and process a refund) and my bank’s tools for the merchant account are equally as awful (I once spent 2 months trying to get access to reporting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web professional in me wants something better. Stripe is that something. But the small, indie business owner in me wants to keep everything as close to home as possible and with the fewest fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I did the simple math using some fake numbers to see if Stripe makes sense for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fees-and-costs&quot;&gt;Fees and Costs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/us/pricing&quot;&gt;Stripe costs 2.9% plus 30¢ per transaction&lt;/a&gt;. If you do $10,000/month in net sales over 500 transactions (averaging $20 per transaction), Stripe takes $440 ($290 in commission + $150 in transaction fees). If you do the same revenue with fewer sales, Stripe will be even cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my situation (and I can only speak to my merchant account terms), the same transactions could cost me more depending on how my customers pay. American Express is an expensive payment method to process (which is why some retailers refuse to accept it). The Visa/Mastercard network charges you based on &lt;em&gt;attempted&lt;/em&gt; transaction. If your site is used as the testing grounds for fraudsters then you could see your account dinged for every attemtped fraudulent charge. And then there’s the monthly fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, about 40% of my customers pay through PayPal instead of with a credit card. This is almost always the case for non-US customers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees&quot;&gt;PayPal charges the same as Stripe&lt;/a&gt; so I am saving on the expensive network charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like PayPal, Stripe hides the variable network credit card fees and simply charges you a flat per transaction fee. They probably do pay a variable per transaction fee to porcess your payments depending on the type of card used but you don’t see it. They can offset those costs by mixing larger transactions with smaller ones, and presumably by negotiating better rates directly with the card networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My guess is that Stripe is using the 25¢ per transaction to cover the network fees and most of the 2.9% is for their operating expenses (staff, servers, security, PCI compliance). But I have no insight into their business so that’s just a &lt;em&gt;wild, simplistic, uninformed guess&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But because Stripe’s customer base varies in amount processed and number of transactions, they can set a flat rate and come out profitable after AMEX and Visa/MC are paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a small business owner who has spent thousands per year on fees, Stripe is appealing just for the fee arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;access-to-the-cash&quot;&gt;Access to the Cash&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major benefit of going with a merchant account is that you get faster access to your money. Revenue from my sales today will be in my business account tomorrow morning when I wake up. It doesn’t get much faster than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I used a hosted e-commerce platform a couple years back, they only paid twice per month. It was nice to have the lump payments come in but that can be tough if you’re in need of the cash. It also wasn’t so nice that a company is holding &lt;em&gt;and earning&lt;/em&gt; off my money even though I’m paying a hefty fee to use the service!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stripe offers two day rolling deposits, which is nice and doable for cashflow. I could do just fine with that if the trade-off was reduced fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chargebacks&quot;&gt;Chargebacks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there’s the chargeback situation. I haven’t had many chargebacks since setting off on my own with a merchant account. But there have been some and they are &lt;em&gt;expensive&lt;/em&gt;. A payment gateway like Authorize.net will typically charge you a hefty fee per chargeback that can be more than the total transaction. That means I lose the sale &lt;em&gt;plus&lt;/em&gt; the fee that was more than the sale. They subtract the fee and sale amount from your nightly settlement so you don’t have time to dispute it. They have direct access to your bank account (and automatically debit fees and chargebacks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stripe doesn’t entirely protect you from chargebacks. They charge $15 per chargeback but refund that if the dispute is resolved in your favor. That’s more than half what other gateways charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-am-i-going-to-switch&quot;&gt;So am I going to switch?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision is centered around the variable fees for different card services, the high chargeback rate, and some future changes for how Mijingo charges for courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing payment gateways is easy enough for me within my e-commerce tool, so it’s worth a month or two trial to see how the fees and experience shake out. I’ll keep you updated.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Moving to Mijingo</title>

   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/happycog/2014/06/27/saying-goodbye-to-happy-cog</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, June 27, 2014, is the last day of an 8-year adventure. It started with Greg Storey hiring me as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airbagindustries.com/archives/airbag/dinkenflicka.php&quot;&gt;first employee at Airbag Industries&lt;/a&gt; and culminated with heading up all technology and development at &lt;a href=&quot;http://happycog.com&quot;&gt;Happy Cog&lt;/a&gt; as VP of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly a decade of client work has &lt;a href=&quot;http://cognition.happycog.com/article/7-lessons-in-8-years-of-client-services&quot;&gt;taught me a lot&lt;/a&gt; along the way and afforded me the opportunity to work with amazing co-workers, clients, companies, and brands. Happy Cog is doing its best work yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seven years ago I started writing my first book, and a year later I published my first screencasts. That slowly built up into a small, profitable, successful side business: &lt;a href=&quot;http://mijingo.com&quot;&gt;Mijingo&lt;/a&gt;. I was diligent in balancing everything; I worked every evening and weekend for a few years so I could continue to publish learning materials while maintaining a full-time job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I had the generous opportunity from Greg Hoy and Greg Storey to partner with Happy Cog and work with the team on some courses. The result was the popular &lt;a href=&quot;http://mijingo.com/products/bundles/the-happy-cog-way/&quot;&gt;The Happy Cog Way series of videos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting on Monday, June 30th, I will be working full-time on &lt;a href=&quot;http://mijingo.com&quot;&gt;Mijingo&lt;/a&gt;, following my passion to build training materials that help people, and growing a business that means a tremendous amount to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Mijingo is now my full-time gig and living, there will be no shortage of updates from me, both here, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mijingo.com&quot;&gt;over at the Mijingo blog&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/mijingo&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whether your opinion is that leadership is mostly positive or negative, you’ve certainly come upon the question: “What does my lead do all day?” A portion of every leader’s day is the detection, triage, and resolution of work we never planned. Sometimes it’s a complex people-related fire drill, sometimes it’s a simple clarifying conversation. But speaking as a leader, I can confidently say that it’s 9:23 am and I have a full calendar of meetings, but I don’t actually know what I’m going to do today. It’s an essential part of the gig.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Moving to OctoPress</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/cms,/internals,/octopress,/jekyll/2014/05/30/moving-to-octopress.html"/>
   
   <updated>2014-05-30T21:53:59-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/cms,/internals,/octopress,/jekyll/2014/05/30/moving-to-octopress</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I moved this site to a more sophisticated version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; (the static site publishing engine). I’m now generateing the site with &lt;a href=&quot;http://octopress.org&quot;&gt;OctoPress&lt;/a&gt;, a theme framework for Jekyll that will make it easier for me to write on the site and, if I decide to, expand it with some more pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent issue of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://us2.campaign-archive1.com/home/?u=a6bdb5e1690471814d869215e&amp;amp;id=426cdc1197&quot;&gt;weekly newsletter of content mangement&lt;/a&gt;, I complained about the friction created by theme-based content management systems. I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Jekyll is a hacking delight when it comes to putting together a static file website. Write in Markdown, use Liquid templates, generate your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Octopress is also Jekylll but more formalized with a theme framework and a few extra tidbits and doodads. It’s simple to get started publishing and quite nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But the theming makes me want to run away. I have a three template website that now requires a chop and paste effort just to get it running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Theme-based systems are great if you stick to a pre-made theme or are willing to create your own. If you just want to get a site up and running with some custom templates, you better up your iron intake because bruising will occur. Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still feel that way but I was able to just wedge my existing site design (“design”) into OctoPress. I still need to go back and properly carve up the templates into the theme parts but for now it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OctoPress comes with some nice Rake tasks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part about the move to OctoPress is that my content migration was just a matter of copying my Markdown post files from one directory to another. A dream content migraton if I’ve ever experienced one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t see myself going back to a database-driven CMS for my personal writing here, but I may decide to give as many static site generators as possible a fair shake.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Domain-Specific German</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2014/04/27/domain-specific-german.html"/>
   
   <updated>2014-04-27T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2014/04/27/domain-specific-german</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I learned the bulk of my German language skills between 1998 and 2003. The first 20 months were the most intensive, as I lived in Germany at the time. The remaining 4 years were spent back in the States finishing up my undergraduate degree (after a few years off) and my graduate degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience in German has been with general every day scenarios and conversation and literature (from my time in school).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of my German knowledge has to do with what I fill my days with now, and have over the last 11 years: technology and web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I’ve done none of my professional career in Germany or in an environment where German is spoken, I’ve picked up very little vocabulary and phrases for those topics. I could easily work my way through a conversation in German about my Mac or about web development but I’d probably lean on English words pretty heavily for any domain-specific vocabulary (most German speakers would graciously allow me to do that because they know what I’m saying).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a nice surprise to see a new podcast by people I already knew through their websites (&lt;a href=&quot;http://simplicitybliss.com/&quot;&gt;Sven Fechner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://rocketink.net/&quot;&gt;Patrick Welker&lt;/a&gt;). Both publish their sites in English so it was fun to hear them share similar information in their mother tongue. I’ve listened to German language podcasts before but they were news/talk oriented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.derubercast.com/&quot;&gt;Übercast&lt;/a&gt; is the name of their new podcast and it covers Apple, technology and other nerdiness. If you speak German it’s a good one to have on your subscription list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m learning a lot by listening because now I have a few more German words and phrases to talk about the stuff I do and use every day.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Traveling Like it's 2014</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2014/03/31/travel-tips-apps-2014-1.html"/>
   
   <updated>2014-03-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2014/03/31/travel-tips-apps-2014-1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is Part 1 of the 2014 edition of my tips on traveling. Part 1 covers apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot more information available than a typical airline employee will share or know. But I like to travel with as much information as is available. The apps I use are all geared toward this. Here are my favorite apps and some tips for traveling in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;airline-apps&quot;&gt;Airline Apps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before a trip I always download the app for the airline on which I’m traveling. Yes, most of the apps are terrible but they offer functionality I can’t get with a third party travel app; I can easily change seats, buy upgrades, and get flight updates (but those apps aren’t always the best for flight status–more on that in a minute).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ryanirelan.com/img/travel-apps.png&quot; alt=&quot;Travel Apps on iOS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my last trip, as I was walking through the Atlanta airport to my gate for my flight home, I opened &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/mobile.html&quot;&gt;Delta’s iOS app&lt;/a&gt; and quickly changed my seat from an exit row aisle seat right side to an exit row aisle seat left side after I noticed that the three exit row seats on the left side were empty. It was more likely that the middle seat would remain empty and I would have even more room than the typical increased leg room (that little hunch was right, by the way).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was about 90 minutes before my flight left and didn’t require me to stand in line or talk to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-travel-apps&quot;&gt;Other Travel Apps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple other apps that I find critical to a saner travel experience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;flighttrack-pro&quot;&gt;FlightTrack Pro&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a new version of this app &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flighttrack-5/id716913565?mt=8&quot;&gt;in the App Store called FlightTrack 5&lt;/a&gt;. Up until writing this article I’ve used the original version of FlightTrack (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macworld.com/product/64840/flighttrack-pro-live-tripit-flight-status-trac.html&quot;&gt;FlightTrack Pro&lt;/a&gt;, no longer available) but the new version is nice and I’ll switch to it. It does not, however, offer TripIt sync like its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ryanirelan.com/img/flightrackpro-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;FlightTrack Pro&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before each trip I enter my entire flight itinerary into FlightTrack Pro. The app sends alerts prior to the flight and for any changes like delays or gate changes. FlightTrack Pro gives you a bit more detail, like that your flight will leave the gate 5 minutes late but is still on-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be angst-inducing at first but once you realize the airlines pad their schedules you’ll be fine. I like the extra information because I like to know as many details about my flights as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FlightTrack Pro and FlightTrack 5 let you easily look up alternative flights based on your itinerary. This is particularly useful when you’re standing in line trying to get rebooked after a cancelled or missed flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;flightaware&quot;&gt;FlightAware&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the &lt;a href=&quot;http://flightaware.com&quot;&gt;FlightAware website&lt;/a&gt; before I downloaded the app. Its main function is live (&lt;a href=&quot;http://flightaware.com/about/faq#howlive&quot;&gt;with a short delay in the US&lt;/a&gt;) flight tracking. FlightAware takes multiple data outlets and combines them. It offers, I think, the best way to track flights. You can also browse flights, see plane tracking photos, and read the latest airline news (aptly called “Squawks &amp;amp; Headlines”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ryanirelan.com/img/flightaware-app.png&quot; alt=&quot;FlightAware App&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FlightAware has a great mobile website and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://flightaware.com/mobile/iphone&quot;&gt;decent iOS app&lt;/a&gt;. While traveling I use FlightAware for one purpose: to track the actual status of my outbound flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many delays are caused by inbound aircraft that are coming from another region with their own weather problems or air traffic congestion. The airlines are slow to post a delay for the outbound flight. If I look at the status of the inbound flight (the aircraft that will handle my flight) I can easily tell my chances of facing a delay on my flight. I usually know about a delay well before it is announced or even posted on the airline website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do this by first pulling up the flight in FlightAware. Then, I scroll down to the bottom of the page (you can do this in both the app and on the website) and choose “Track Inbound Flights.” You can even track the inbound flight of your inbound flight and trace any delays further back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This comes in handy if you are running late on a connection and want to see if a inbound flight delay will work in your favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More in the next part of Traveling Like it’s 2014 where we’ll talk about luggage, gear, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tech as a Means to an End</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m a programmer. But I hate conversations about what “stack” I’m using. I love programming because it is a means to an end - creating a product that customers love. I’m not the kind of tech guy who experiments with new stuff for the sake of it. I view tech through the lens of customer benefits - can a piece of technology improve customer experience somehow (e.g. make the app run faster etc)? If so, great - I’ll check it out. If no, but it’s whizzy and new - I’ll pass thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a problem in the programming/development world but we can definitely miss the product for the tools quite often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The enemy often tries to make us attempt and start many projects so that we will be overwhelmed with too many tasks, and therefore achieve nothing and leave everything unfinished. Sometimes he even suggests the wish to undertake some excellent work that he foresees we will never accomplish. This is to distract us from the prosecution of some less excellent work that we would have easily completed. He does not care how many plans and beginnings we make, provided nothing is finished. – &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_de_Sales&quot;&gt;Saint Francis de Sales&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books/about/Finding_God_s_Will_for_You.html?id=AXoEAAAACAAJ&quot;&gt;Finding God’s Will for You&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Impatiently Grazing On Music</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2014/01/22/impatiently-grazing-on-music.html"/>
   
   <updated>2014-01-22T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2014/01/22/impatiently-grazing-on-music</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last year I quit &lt;a href=&quot;http://rdio.com&quot;&gt;Rdio&lt;/a&gt;. I made a few comments about it to co-workers (okay, maybe more than a few; sorry) but otherwise kept quiet. Part of this was because I knew people that worked at Rdio and I didn’t want my personal decision to somehow be a judgement of their work (it is not).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I quit Rdio is because I was unhappy with how my music habits had changed in a world of the all-you-can-eat buffet of songs and albums. I found myself impatiently grazing on music, popping from one album to the next. I would blast through several albums in a day and never go back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of music as an investment (of time, money, emotional energy) was gone. Rdio had no boundaries and I had no limits. I just grazed and grazed. I was never full because I never stopped to really listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelongwinters.com&quot;&gt;John Roderick of The Long Winters&lt;/a&gt; was recently interview on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/cmdspace/77&quot;&gt;Cmd+Space podcast&lt;/a&gt; where he talked about the work behind writing, recording, releasing, and promoting an album. In classic Roderick fashion, John had an honest (perhaps poignant) take on the state of music (transcript excerpt from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marco.org/2014/01/21/roderick-cmd-space&quot;&gt;Marco Arment’s post on the same topic&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When a Marvin Gaye record came out 40 years ago, presumably, you went and spent your record-buying allowance on it, and you brought it home and listened to it exclusively for 2 weeks. It was an investment. This was it! You’re going to listen to this, or you’ve got an AM radio and a newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now, we’re just clicking through songs. “How does this one sound? Oh, that’s good. How does this one sound? Pretty good. This one’s good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’re just flipping through index cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was me with Rdio. Even in the age of iTunes, where music costs much less than it did when I was a kid, the act of paying per album forces you to consider the music you listen to. Switching back to iTunes, direct artist purchases, and vinyl + mp3 releases, was how I broke myself of the habit of mindlessly grazing on music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent a lot more on music in the last year than I ever did on Rdio but the result is a collection I adore because I listened to every album dozens of times. Just like I used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently indulging in:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Steve Goodman Train</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2014/01/20/steve-goodman-train.html"/>
   
   <updated>2014-01-20T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2014/01/20/steve-goodman-train</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Previously, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ryanirelan.com/articles/john-prine-roger-ebert/&quot;&gt;I was talking about the intersection of John Prine and Roger Ebert&lt;/a&gt; during the Chicago folk revival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key player in that–and one less well-known because of his early death–is Steve Goodman. Steve who?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve “The guy who wrote City of New Orleans” Goodman, that’s who.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/X7ATpP9lsVw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Goodman also penned songs that Jimmy Buffet covered and is considered the songwriters songwriter. I discovered Steve through John Prine and then started digging more and eventually got ahold of some of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Steve-Goodman-Live-Austin-Limits/dp/B00008AOSZ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1390272416&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=steve+goodman+dvd&quot;&gt;Steve’s first show at Austin City Limits in 1977 on DVD&lt;/a&gt; through the Austin Public Library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On that DVD I was introduced to the Steve I had read about and heard about in &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;interviews with his friend and contemporaries&lt;/a&gt;. His high-energy performance of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5xEY8JU16E&quot;&gt;The Twentieth Century is Almost Over&lt;/a&gt; was my favorite of the set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/Q5xEY8JU16E?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I’ve been to two Austin City Limits tapings, but oh how I wish I could’ve been in the audience of some of those early tapings. What an amazing history.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Goodman was diganosed with leukemia in 1969, at only 20 years old, and fought it off for the next 14 years, until he &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20086055,00.html&quot;&gt;died in 1984&lt;/a&gt;. He was only 36 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just to keep Ebert tied into this, he &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rogerebert.com/balder-and-dash/new-years-with-steve-in-tribute-to-a-great-heart&quot;&gt;wrote a great tribute to Steve in 2012&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>John Prine & Roger Ebert</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2014/01/12/john-prine-roger-ebert.html"/>
   
   <updated>2014-01-12T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2014/01/12/john-prine-roger-ebert</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember the first time I purposely listened to John Prine. I think it was through the same friend that introduced me to Harry Nilsson. It would make sense because I hold both artists in high, high regard. That friend of mine had (I haven’t seen him in 10 years) never told me to listen to something I didn’t end up liking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to see John Prine play live back in August 2003 (thank you, world wide web, for allowing me to look that up) in North Carolina where he played with Nancy Griffith. We had third row seats at the Regency Park Ampitheater in Cary. Awesome show and a big music education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Prine was in the armed forces stationed in Germany, he went to Chicago where he spent his days as a postal worker and eventually got the guts to perform open mic sessions at local clubs at night. He became part of the folk revival in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And who else was in Chicago at the same time? None other than Roger Ebert. In fact, in 1970 Ebert wrote the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rogerebert.com/balder-and-dash/john-prine-american-legend&quot;&gt;first review of John Prine&lt;/a&gt;. When Ebert wrote this review John Prine had only been performing for three months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a note before he reprinted the review on his blog, Ebert wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Through no wisdom of my own but out of sheer blind luck, I walked into the Fifth Peg, a folk club on West Armitage, one night in 1970 and heard a mailman from Westchester singing. This was John Prine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He sang his own songs. That night I heard “Sam Stone,” one of the great songs of the century. And “Angel from Montgomery.” And others. I wasn’t the music critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, but I went to the office and wrote an article. And that, as fate decreed, was the first review Prine ever received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the show, Ebert had this to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He appears on stage with such modesty he almost seems to be backing into the spotlight. He sings rather quietly, and his guitar work is good, but he doesn’t show off. He starts slow. But after a song or two, even the drunks in the room begin to listen to his lyrics. And then he has you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rogerebert.com/balder-and-dash/john-prine-american-legend&quot;&gt;Read the review&lt;/a&gt;, pick up some Prine, and then tell me you’re not hooked, too.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The first story in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Surely-Feynman-Adventures-Curious-Character/dp/0393316041&quot;&gt;Richard Feynman’s fine collection of personal stories&lt;/a&gt; is about his work as a boy fixing radios. Early on, Feynman learned that he was much more successful when he stopped and thought before approaching a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was fixing a radio for a man who didn’t understand this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So the guy says, “What are you doing? You come to fix the radio, but you’re only walking back and forth!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I say, “I’m thinking!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After fixing the man’s radio, Feynman got some referral work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He got me other jobs, and kept telling everybody what a tremendous genius I was, saying, “He fixes radios by &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt;!”&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My Twitter Moment</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2013/11/13/my-twitter-moment.html"/>
   
   <updated>2013-11-13T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2013/11/13/my-twitter-moment</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I get a lot of things wrong. And with something as weird as Twitter was one year into its existence, I didn’t see how it would fit in to what my day-to-day life and my work. I was pessimistic of its success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2007, during SXSW Interactive, I was pacing in the upstairs lobby of the Hampton Inn in Austin. A reporter from the Wall Street Journal, Andrew LaValee, had called me a few mintues earlier just as I stepped off the hotel elevator. He noticed I had written about Twitter and wanted to get my take on the service. I was more than pessmistic as I found the constant stream of updates distracting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB117373145818634482&quot;&gt;From the article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I probably started removing people the first week,” said Ryan Irelan, 31, a Web developer in Raleigh, N.C., who began using Twitter last year. “This constant dinging of updates,” he added, “it really just became totally overwhelming. I don’t see how anyone could get anything done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said a lot worse things than that during the interview, including that I saw Twitter as a social tool for teenagers, not for adults who were busy with work and life. Like most journalists who write these types of pieces, Andrew had his own angle he was trying to tell. Fortunately, (for me) he didn’t include in the final article some of the most pessimistic views I shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course I was wrong. Twitter, while still overwhelming at times, has been important to me for establishing professional and personal relationships, and spreading the word about my &lt;a href=&quot;http://mijingo.com/products&quot;&gt;training materials at Mijingo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter is still the first way I promote something new I create and the response on Twitter is usually a good measure of its future success.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Evernote OCR Recognized My Handwriting</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2013/10/28/evernote-ocr-handwriting.html"/>
   
   <updated>2013-10-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2013/10/28/evernote-ocr-handwriting</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This Summer I made the switch over to Evernote for document management. Previously, I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/devonthink-pro-office.html&quot;&gt;DEVONthink Pro Office&lt;/a&gt;, which I still recommend wholeheartedly to people who can benefit from its amazing AI that helps you find the information and files you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My needs slowly evolved to more archiving and notetaking so Evernote became a logical choice. I also needed better support across my devices, so I could &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/04382dcb-aae0-4dd7-ac02-280507bc75bf/7c6a4c61234f1918c57ac206c9029619&quot;&gt;snap a photo of the coffee I’m brewing this week&lt;/a&gt; with my phone or quickly take meeting notes on my iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was reluctant to switch but when I discovered this I knew it was worth it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/evernote-ocr.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Evernote OCR handwriting&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I regularly take handwritten notes–while brainstorming ideas, during meetings or conversations–and until I used Evernote I always had to re-capture them in digital form manually. No more.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why Teaching With Context Always Wins</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2013/07/29/teaching-with-context.html"/>
   
   <updated>2013-07-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2013/07/29/teaching-with-context</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Give the pupils something to do, not something to learn; and the doing is of such a nature as to demand thinking; learning naturally results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;– John Dewey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My high school algebra teacher “phoned it in.” Her classroom instruction consisted of slapping one transparency after another on the overhead projector and in a monotone voice going over the each and every line. She explained the concepts of basic algebra by just reading the slide on the screen. There wasn’t any enthusiasm and there certainly wasn’t any way for me to relate to my world what she was teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relating what you’re teaching to your students–teaching with context–is one ingredient of helping your students succeed. Your students could be in a classroom in front of you, viewers of a digital training course you created, or the readers of documentation you wrote. Your students could even be the attendees of a talk you’re giving at a conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three-useful-examples-are-better-than-none&quot;&gt;Three Useful Examples are Better Than None&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://ellislab.com/expressionengine&quot;&gt;ExpressionEngine CMS&lt;/a&gt; has always had thorough documentation. For non-developers, the concept of relationships between content entries–and how to think about them and output them–can be more difficult to grasp than other parts of the CMS. Because of that the creators of ExpressionEngine &lt;a href=&quot;http://ellislab.com/expressionengine/user-guide/modules/channel/relationships.html#id14&quot;&gt;wrote up &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; different contexts&lt;/a&gt; in which you would use relationships between entries in ExpressionEngine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating a menu for a pizza shop&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating a schedule for a music venue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating a teams and games schedule for a community sports league&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are examples. But they’re not just completely contrived examples. They are examples that the reader of the docs might actually encounter while using ExpressionEngine (or at least related enough that they have something to hook into and get started). Each one has &lt;a href=&quot;http://ellislab.com/expressionengine/user-guide/modules/channel/relationships.html#the-pizza-shop&quot;&gt;detailed information and code&lt;/a&gt;; exactly what someone struggling with the concept of relationships in ExpressionEngine would encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;learning-geometry-through-carpentry&quot;&gt;Learning Geometry Through Carpentry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had another teacher in high school (my two experiences were so vivid that I remember this all 20 years later) who taught Geometry. All of his examples had to do with him and his Dad working in their carpentry business during the Summer months when school was in recess. Whether it was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem&quot;&gt;Pythagorean Theorem&lt;/a&gt; or finding the area of a rectangle, he always had an example about a problem he faced in the previous summer’s carpentry work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what was the difference between the two teachers and approaches? I was bored in my Algebra class and attentive in my Geometry class. I also did better in my Geometry class (although I was never a great math student in general).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My geometry teacher gave me a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDf8NEAWYCw&quot;&gt;real world situation with which to frame the geometry&lt;/a&gt; he was teaching. The context he used help me relate the geometry concepts to something I’d better understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His examples also kept my attention. And if a teacher loses her students attention it’s over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reusable-and-repurposable-information&quot;&gt;Reusable and Repurposable Information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond just teaching within a real-world context is filling that context with information that the student can reuse and repurpose later on. If I’m teaching how to use a piece of technology like a content management system I always try to teach the concepts in a context in which the student will most likely find herself using them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I’m teaching how to use a file upload and management part of a CMS I might use it in a tutorial to create a slideshow or carousel; these are both very common use cases on websites we build today. The student learns how to use the tool in the CMS while creating something she’ll probably have to create a dozen times. That information now has more value than it ever did before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-started&quot;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the time to decide how you want to frame what you’re teaching. You do need a checklist of teachable items, but along with those you need to &lt;em&gt;decide how you’re going to frame the entire lesson&lt;/em&gt;. Will it be in the context of a building contractor working on a house and using geometry? Or will it be in the context of a designer building a portfolio website using a content management system?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of those are very practical applications of the information that help us learn better, faster and retain more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The courses I produce a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mijingo.com&quot;&gt;Mijingo&lt;/a&gt; are all delivered within a context that helps form the lesson. &lt;a href=&quot;https://mijingo.com/products&quot;&gt;Watch one for yourself&lt;/a&gt; to see teaching and learning in context in practice and why it &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; wins.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Finally Learning to GTD</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2013/07/22/finally-learning-to-gtd.html"/>
   
   <updated>2013-07-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2013/07/22/finally-learning-to-gtd</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the end of June I attended a one-day &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidco.com/individuals/public-seminars/mastering-workflow&quot;&gt;Getting Things Done™ Mastering Workflow seminar by the David Allen Company&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to that seminar I had been using the Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology/system for about the last five years and aware of it for the last eight years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I haven’t always been good as I could be and sometimes my entire system of organizing projects and actions fell apart. This was most likely to happen during times of high stress, heavy workload and change in routine (travel, moving across the country, etc.). These are just the times the GTD system actually makes a difference and helps you steer straight ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But over the last 6 months, since my responsibilities at &lt;a href=&quot;http://happycog.com&quot;&gt;Happy Cog&lt;/a&gt; have changed and become more complex, I worked hard to refine my GTD system again so it was more reliable. Part of that refinement was to make sure I was clear on GTD best practices and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I couldn’t do it on my own. I needed someone qualified to teach me about GTD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Cog offers a generous professional development budget to each team member and I was able to use some of that budget to attend the Mastering Workflow seminar. My seminar presenter was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidco.com/presenters-coaches&quot;&gt;James Stevenson&lt;/a&gt;. He was one of the best presenters and speakers I’ve seen. He had a level of polish and command of the material that you rarely see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until the seminar my only training on GTD was through the audiobook version of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280&quot;&gt;Getting Things Done book&lt;/a&gt;, a Kindle version of the book, regular reading of GTD-related articles online, and best practices of setting up &lt;a href=&quot;http://omnifocus.com&quot;&gt;OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt;, my task management software (and the hub of my trusted GTD system).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of the free information online, you might think I didn’t need the GTD class. Why pay for a class to hear a knowledgeable presenter share the same information? That’s a softball question. You pay for classes like that because there’s &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of value in re-learning something from someone who has mastered it. The GTD coaches and presenters are just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are movies that you probably watch several times. After the first viewing you think you saw everything, know the plot, the character development, flaws and motivations. But watch the same movie again and you find something new. Watch it yet again and you discover another angle or detail in the plot. Listen to the director commentary–or read an interview with the director or writer–and you get additional information about the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what the Mastering Workflow seminar was for me. I’ve had GTD implemented in various forms for 5 years and spent dozens of hours researching it. But hearing someone else talk about it, explain it, and help others learn it, exposed all sorts of new information and ideas to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw glaring holes in my own system, my thinking about GTD and how I approach it. I had slowly built up some bad habits and the class helped me recognize those and work to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last month I’ve been working on fixing the issues and making my system even stronger. It just took hearing it from a different source, with a different view, and a complete command of the material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m glad to have finally learned how to GTD.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How I Learned to Teach</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2013/07/10/teaching-in-context.html"/>
   
   <updated>2013-07-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2013/07/10/teaching-in-context</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On January 7, 1998 I packed two duffle bags, containing almost everything I owned, and boarded a Delta Airlines flight in Atlanta on a one-way ticket. I spent the following 20 months living, working, and learning in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I moved there to live closer to my girlfriend (she’s now my wife of almost 14 years), who was born and raised in a northern Germany city near the Baltic Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I arrived in Germany, I couldn’t speak any German. So, I did the most logical thing one would do: I panicked. After I was done panicking and generally being mopey, I enrolled in German language class at the city’s Volkshochschule (“&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_high_school&quot;&gt;folk high school&lt;/a&gt;”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The class was filled with students aged 15 to 80 and from all over the world: Iran, Iraq, Japan, Russia, Australia, Turkey, and Poland. We all spoke different languages so we had no common language with which to communicate. Our teacher didn’t speak her students’ languages so her only way to communicate with all of us was &lt;em&gt;in German&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A German class taught &lt;em&gt;in German&lt;/em&gt;? Seems strange, I know. It’s a challenge as both the student and the teacher, but eventually you adapt and realize that by being forced to hear and speak German from day one of the class, you are removed of the crutch of your native tongue. Do you want to ask to use the restroom? You better quickly figure out how to ask in German. Do you want to converse with your fellow students during class or on a break? Your only common language is German, so you better piece together that sentence with the words and grammar you have right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learned German using real-world situations that we would be confronted with after leaving the class: buying groceries, ordering dinner at a restaurant, or going to the government office to get a work permit. All of our examples during class were within the context of the lives we would lead after we left the classroom. We were foreigners trying to be understood in a country with a language we haven’t mastered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning a language in the target language and in an environment where you are forced to immediately use the skills is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_immersion&quot;&gt;immersive language learning&lt;/a&gt;. Immersive language learning takes on many forms but the key is this: &lt;strong&gt;it’s easier and faster to learn a foreign language when the learner is forced to learn in that language and can anchor the information to a real-life context&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a school year of German, I was nearly fluent. In one year I went from knowing nothing to being able to hold a job that required me to talk to customers and co-workers all day. I thought–and sometimes dreamed–in German.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years after returning from Germany, I was a graduate student teaching elementary German to undergraduates. On the first day of the semester I walked into the classroom, stood in front of the class and introduced myself … in German. How I learned German was how I now taught German (thanks to an excellent teaching program). This was my first experience preparing a curriculum that used immersive learning techniques. It worked for me and it worked for my students. That experience stuck with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;http://mijingo.com&quot;&gt;Mijingo&lt;/a&gt;, the courses we create are not for learning foreign languages (well, not yet), but they are about learning something foreign to the student.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make learning better for the students of our courses, we always teach within a real-world context. If we’re teaching a new CMS, we always use a simplified sample project that is something you might actually build for yourself or a client. If we’re teaching a new productivity tool, we use examples that students can relate to and will probably encounter in their own use of the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some questions we ask to help better construct our courses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In which types of scenarios will the student find themselves when trying to apply this information?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What’s the most common way someone would use this information?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How can we cover the relevant topics while still creating something that is useful to the student?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does the sample project include enough information to be useful while still being simple enough that it can be built in the course?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These questions help keep the courses focused on making it as easy as possible for the student to really learn what we’re teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immersive learning isn’t limited to just languages. You can use it to teach and learn anything: code, software, content management systems, development frameworks, or productivity workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning German in an immersive, contextual way helped me learn the language faster and easier. That learning success taught &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; how to teach others.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The App.net Appeal</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2013/05/14/the-appnet-appeal.html"/>
   
   <updated>2013-05-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2013/05/14/the-appnet-appeal</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since they did the original fund-raising campaign I’ve been a subscriber to the App.net network. Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://join.app.net/from/ppdcyyyrrc&quot;&gt;you can sign up, too&lt;/a&gt;. They gave me a bunch of invitations for you to use. Go for it. When you join, say hi; I’m &lt;a href=&quot;http://alpha.app.net/ryanirelan&quot;&gt;@ryanirelan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, at this point in time, App.net is a place where I can slow down and have real conversations with people I know and people I find interesting. Because you can write longer posts the thoughts tend to be more, well, &lt;em&gt;thoughtful&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend I was in &lt;a href=&quot;https://alpha.app.net/lexfri/post/5556072#5548397&quot;&gt;a discussion about transcripts for podcasts&lt;/a&gt;. I think we are losing a lot of great information by not having the content of the many great audio shows available for search engines to crawl and people with hearing disabilities to experience in a way that works for them. The Internet has opened up so much information to the world and to those who otherwise wouldn’t be able to find it. Transcripts of audio recordings are just another part of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conversation on App.net led to me to have a separate offline conversation about &lt;a href=&quot;http://mijingo.com&quot;&gt;Mijingo&lt;/a&gt; sponsoring a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.muleradio.net/unprofessional/&quot;&gt;podcast’s&lt;/a&gt; effort to add transcripts to their shows. I put my money where my mouth is, as they say. It’s not a big effort but I’m hopeful it’s at least a start. And I plan to do it more in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Previsualizing Happiness</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2013/02/24/previsualizing-happiness.html"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My childhood next door neighbor taught a martial arts class in his converted basement. He was a black belt in Vadha, a himalayan martial arts form. One of the things we did in the class, besides learning a series of moves to help us take out a bad guy on the street, was breaking wood &lt;em&gt;with our bare hands&lt;/em&gt;. We broke a one-inch thick pine board in half (along the grain, of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breaking boards was never about strength. It was about knowing the technique: a good wind up, hitting the right spot, and following through. In order to get good at that technique and repeat it, board after broken board, my instructor told us to visualize breaking the board first and then make the attempt. That was my first introduction to previsualization; think through the steps of breaking the board, &lt;em&gt;see yourself break it&lt;/em&gt;, and then do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;see-the-swish&quot;&gt;See the Swish&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I played on my middle school’s basketball team (warming the bench for two years) and had a great coach who taught more than just basketball fundamentals. From him I learned the phrase “perfect practice makes perfect” that I still cite to this day, 25 years later.  He also taught me to previsualize when making free throws. &lt;em&gt;See the shot go in first and it will.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free throws, which are uncontested shots awarded after a foul, are only 15 feet from the basket and should be an easy way to make points. The only way to get good at free throws is to practice–perfect practice–good technique: square to the basket, bend your knees and follow through. And the only way to get this right every time is to first visualize yourself taking and making the shot. See it all the way through until the ball goes in the basket. Then take your shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;proper-exposure&quot;&gt;Proper Exposure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In college I had a short stint as a photography major (although I don’t think I ever officially declared). This was before digital photography was common–or even affordable–so my education was based on “wet photography” methods. We started with black and white photography. When you start with black and white you have to learn the Zone System.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Zone System, co-created by photography giant Ansel Adams, is an involved system of producing perfectly exposed and printed black and white photos. It requires knowing your tools well (camera, film, enlarger, paper, chemicals) and accurately measuring light during exposure. In the Zone System you decide what your final image will look like before you even open the shutter to expose the film, i.e. you previsiualize it. Previsualization forces the photographer to carefully measure light–in the shadows and highlights–and see the scene in black and white before the photo is made. Previsualization is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; idea behind the Zone System.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;happiness&quot;&gt;Happiness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently reread Jeff Atwood’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/buying-happiness.html&quot;&gt;Buying Happiness&lt;/a&gt; article. In it Jeff theorizes that money can buy happiness but the details of how you spend it matter. “Buying Happiness” has a lot of good information that goes against the grain in how a typical person approaches money, spending and happiness. One thing stuck out for me under item number 6 (“Think about what you’re not thinking about”) in Jeff’s list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We tend to gloss over details when considering future purchases, but research shows that our happiness (or unhappiness) largely lies in exactly those tiny details we aren’t thinking about. Before making a major purchase, consider the mechanics and logistics of owning this thing, and where your actual time will be spent once you own it. Try to imagine a typical day in your life, in some detail, hour by hour: how will it be affected by this purchase?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previsualization!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do this quite frequently when I’m considering changing anything in my life (whether major, like starting a family or changing a job or minor like buying a new car or rearranging a room).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may really want that new car but I might not think through what it’ll mean to own it. How will the payments impact my monthly budget? Is it practical for me day-to-day? Can it fit my family comfortably? What’s the insurance premium? Will I actually drive it enough to make the expense worth it? Is it comfortable enough for someone my height on long trips?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost bought a new car 2 years ago but held off after previsualizing a month or two of owning it. I realized the car would make me unhappy in a few ways, so I called my salesman and canceled the deal. Looking back, it ended up being the right choice. That car would have not been right for me and I’m happier without it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we walk through–or previsualize–living with a decision for even only a month a lot of things become obvious to us and many times it’ll change our decision and increase our happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like breaking a piece of wood in half, swishing a free throw, or creating the perfectly exposed photograph, you have a better chance at a successful or happy outcome if you see yourself doing it first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to try a lot of stuff. New services, web apps, and even content sites. But I am terrible at keeping up with what I’m trying. So I started putting them all into a “beta” bookmarks folder in Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The services themselves aren’t in beta (although some may be). They’re just in beta in my workflow and can be deleted or abandoned at any time if I don’t find the service or website useful to my day-to-day work and fun.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Multiple Sorting Options in Apple Mail</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2013/01/28/multiple-sorting-apple-mail.html"/>
   
   <updated>2013-01-28T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2013/01/28/multiple-sorting-apple-mail</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I like to think I’m pretty good at managing my email and how often I check it. &lt;a href=&quot;http://cognition.happycog.com/article/the-best-email-in-the-world&quot;&gt;I’ve written about this before at the Happy Cog Cognition blog&lt;/a&gt; and I’m still using most of those techniques and ideas. But in the last few months my email load has increased dramatically and if I have a busy day (or travel) I can quickly get buried. This has caused me to get behind and have a backlog of unread messages. That’s a bummer, so I’m trying to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help me process my email I now have two different sorting settings depending on which view I’m using in Apple Mail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For my Unified Inbox, I sort by date, so the newest messages are always on top.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When I select an individual email account inbox (e.g. “Happy Cog”), the messages are sorted by unread, so the unread messages are at the top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does this help?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Unified Inbox is where I first go when I’m checking my email, so I always want to see the newest messages at the top. This is my “I’m just checking” inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The individual mail account inboxes (I have up to five, depending on the computer), are where I go to triage my email backlog or to manage unread messages that have gotten buried. If you’re into Getting Things Done™ and OmniFocus then this view is like my weekly review perspective. I use it to ensure I’m not missing or forgetting something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the addition of the Favorites Bar in Apple Mail, I can easily toggle between different inboxes and« the sorting choice is preserved.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Auto-Quit DEVONthink (or any other app)</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2013/01/27/quit-devonthink-quick-tip.html"/>
   
   <updated>2013-01-27T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2013/01/27/quit-devonthink-quick-tip</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A quick, simple tip I mentioned last week when I was on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nonbreakingspace.tv/&quot;&gt;Non-Breaking Space Show podcast&lt;/a&gt; (not yet out, but soon!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past I’ve run into problems where my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/devonthink-pro-office.html&quot;&gt;DEVONthink Pro Office&lt;/a&gt; database would get corrupt and then I’d be left with a little clean-up or, worse, some missing data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The corruption happens because I use Dropbox to sync my databases between my laptop I use for work and my Mac Pro at home. I use my Mac Pro a lot in the evevnings for personal stuff (scanning papers, paying bills, editing video) and DEVONthink is one of my most used apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DEVONthink doesn’t like it if you try to open a database again before it was properly closed. It displays a dialog box that the databases are open (it knows because of the Dropbox sync) but still allows me to move forward and open them again on a second machine. This can result in database corruption or data loss. I experienced it while working on my talk for &lt;a href=&quot;http://eeciconf.com&quot;&gt;EECI&lt;/a&gt; last year. It wasn’t catastrophic but I lost a few hours worth of research. That sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep from getting the warning and to prevent any database issues, I have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/&quot;&gt;Keyboard Maestro&lt;/a&gt; macro that runs every night at 2:30 AM called “Nightly Quit DevonThink.” It’s dead-simple: quit the app at 2:30 AM every day of the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/devonthink-quit-keyboard-maestro.png&quot; alt=&quot;Keyboard Maestro macro to quit DEVONthink Pro Office at certain time&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No more database issues or warning messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;First, I must admit that I wrote this book for myself. Truth be told, I crafted this material so I could drink my own Kool-Aid and always remember what it tastes like. In other words, I wanted a reference written in my own words used to jog my memory as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>An Incomplete Introduction to John Hartford</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2012/10/28/john-hartford.html"/>
   
   <updated>2012-10-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2012/10/28/john-hartford</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever had a conversation with me about music, I’ve probably brought up &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnhartford.com/&quot;&gt;John Hartford&lt;/a&gt;. You might know him from the &lt;em&gt;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&lt;/em&gt; soundtrack. Like all of the musicians on that album, their work is well established prior to the movie. John Hartford won a Grammy all the way back in 1968 for his song &lt;em&gt;Gentle on My Mind&lt;/em&gt;, which was made popular in a recording by Glen Campbell (and later by many, many other artists).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are John and Glen performing the song together:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/TW7OFAir3OQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This live version was a little too dolled up for my taste. The cheeseball ending by the band isn’t the greatest tribute to such a beautiful song. But Nashville has a way of doing that to good music.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite version of this song is the one John sang in his &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_from_Mountain_Stage&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Live from Mountain Stage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; concert. The tempo is faster than most recordings of the song and it has a certain summertime swing to it that will stick with you. I always find myself humming along with the banjo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rd.io/x/QFpdKxlqLw&quot;&gt;Listen to &lt;em&gt;Gentle on My Mind&lt;/em&gt; on Rdio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/gentle-on-my-mind/id4530876?i=4530860&quot;&gt;Buy &lt;em&gt;Gentle on My Mind&lt;/em&gt; on iTunes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a great video of him singing with some bluegrass legends. This is how John meant the song to sound:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/_pdzFaGg-4M&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beyond-gentle-on-my-mind&quot;&gt;Beyond Gentle on My Mind&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beause of the success of Gentle on My Mind, John was able to record the music he wanted, how we wanted. What followed was some amazing–sometimes unorthodox–work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aereo-plain&quot;&gt;Aereo-Plain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Bugle&quot;&gt;Morning Bugle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twang&quot;&gt;Mark Twang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gum_Tree_Canoe&quot;&gt;Gum Tree Canoe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_Waltz&quot;&gt;Annual Waltz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t been a fan of John Hartford for very long. I first heard his music around 2000 when I was living in Tennessee. A friend had a bluegrass show on the local college radio station and played &lt;em&gt;Don’t Leave Your Records in the Sun&lt;/em&gt; with a shout out to me. I was hooked. The song is off John’s &lt;em&gt;Mark Twang&lt;/em&gt; album, which covers his love for steamboats (he eventually became a licensed steam riverboat pilot).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rd.io/x/QFpdK8OIwQ&quot;&gt;Listen to &lt;em&gt;Don’t Leave Your Records in the Sun&lt;/em&gt; on Rdio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/dont-leave-your-records-in/id2564807?i=2564793&quot;&gt;Buy &lt;em&gt;Don’t Leave Your Records in the Sun&lt;/em&gt; on iTunes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a live version with a great band (including Sam Bush) behind him:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/DKZR8KBcekQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never had the opportunity to hear Hartford play live. A year after I first heard his music he died from non-hodgkins lymphoma, which he had battled for years. As we grow older we start to race against time when trying to see some of our musical heros play live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-to-start&quot;&gt;Where to Start?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first John Hartford album I really got into was &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aereo-plain&quot;&gt;Aereo-Plain&lt;/a&gt;. I listened to it near non-stop for a month. It’s where I started, so you should, too. It’s also considered the genesis of the “New Grass” movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aereo-Plain is available on iTunes and Rdio. You might even be able to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B008R9WPU4/ref=sr_1_2_up_1_main_olp?s=music&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1351479868&amp;amp;sr=1-2&amp;amp;condition=used&quot;&gt;find it on vinyl&lt;/a&gt;. If you enjoy Aereo-Plain (and you will), give &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_Powered_Aereo-Takes&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steam Powered Aereo-Takes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a listen. It is an entire album of outtakes, alternate versions and demos from the Aereo-Plain sessions. It was released in 2002, after Hartford died. Hartford’s band on the album included Norman Blake and Randy Scruggs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gum_Tree_Canoe&quot;&gt;Gum Tree Canoe&lt;/a&gt; is a fun album that is more produced (layers and layers of instruments) than Aereo-Plain. But the songs are just as wonderful. He recorded a fun version of &lt;em&gt;Little Piece of my Heart&lt;/em&gt;. My daughter (almost 2 years old as I write this) and I regularly dance to this album. Great for Saturday morning fun. Open the windows and turn it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also created an &lt;a href=&quot;http://rd.io/x/QFpdL1Xe4g&quot;&gt;Rdio playlist called John Hartford Starter&lt;/a&gt; with some of my favorite John Hartford songs. But please don’t use this as the only way to discover his music. The songs truly stick together better in the original album form. Consider my playlist just a snapshot of my personal favorites, not representative of his catalog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the music.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Jekyll Screencast</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2012/09/11/jekyll-screencast-mijingo.html"/>
   
   <updated>2012-09-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2012/09/11/jekyll-screencast-mijingo</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last July I &lt;a href=&quot;http://ryanirelan.com/articles/navel-gazing/&quot;&gt;wrote about the changes I made to this site&lt;/a&gt; earlier in the year. For the last 16 months I’ve been powering this site using &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, a Ruby tool that generates static websites from content and template files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my post last Summer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This Spring I moved the site to Jekyll, which isn’t really a CMS at all. It’s a Ruby tool that generates a static website from a series of text files for entries and layout files. Every time I write a new entry (like this one) the site is completely regenerated. Movable Type did this, too, but Jekyll doesn’t have a GUI, isn’t a web application (you run it completely on your local machine), is free and surely won’t be sold to some weird advertising company. Also, Jekyll generates my site from Markdown files, which are just text files and will never fall victim to obsolete software. Sounds like a winner to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love using Jekyll because writing and publishing is simple and doesn’t involve anything except my favorite text editor (I’m writing this in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sublimetext.com/2&quot;&gt;Sublime Text 2&lt;/a&gt;) and the Terminal application in OS X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning I released a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mijingo.com/products/screencasts/static-websites-with-jekyll/&quot;&gt;Mijingo video tutorial on Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; that walks you through everything you need to do to get a site like this one up and running. The complete code for the example site is included, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video packs a lot of information into 32 minutes and you’ll be able to quickly get started doing your own site.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Review of the Leaf HD Antenna</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2012/06/28/review-of-the-leaf-antenna.html"/>
   
   <updated>2012-06-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2012/06/28/review-of-the-leaf-antenna</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I installed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004QK7HI8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=eein-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B004QK7HI8&quot;&gt;Leaf television antenna&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gomohu.com/&quot;&gt;Mohu&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is simple: most HD television antennas are expensive and are just horribly (over) designed. The Leaf is just a paper thin, square attenna laminated in plastic. Out from the bottom of the Leaf is a coaxial cable that you connect to your television.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here was my experience hooking up the Leaf:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unpacked it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connected the coaxial cable that protrudes from the bottom of the Leaf my television.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Casually dropped the leaf on the table next to my television.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turned on the television and started a digital channel scan.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Poured a drink.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the scan was complete I had about 12 channels. The network channels (and KLRU, our local PBS affiliate) were all in crystal clear HD. Just like you would get on cable television connection (but maybe better).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No cable box, no exorbinant fees. But also no ESPN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Leaf isn’t inexpensive. At $35 it costs more than a lot of antennas you can get. But, unlike other antennas, you can hide the Leaf behind your television, behind a frame on the wall, or–if you have good HD signal like I do–just about anywhere you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results you get from it will depend on the signal strength where you live. If you have poor signal strength, you might need a big honking antenna on your roof or in your attic. If that is your situation, the Leaf probably won’t work for you. But I can’t say for certain because my house is bathing in broadcast signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Austin the network affiliate broadcast towers are all just west of the city, less than 5 miles from my house.  If you live in central Austin you should have plenty of coverage to get all of the channels without a problem. I looked up the coverage beforehand on &lt;a href=&quot;http://transition.fcc.gov/mb/engineering/maps/&quot;&gt;the DTV.gov site&lt;/a&gt; and once I was sure I had sufficient coverage at my house I purchased the Leaf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what your reasons are for choosing broadcast television over cable, if you live in an area with good reception you should get the Leaf. I was skeptical at first but it has worked flawlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Block Apps on OS X with Keyboard Maestro</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2012/04/17/block-apps-keyboard-maestro.html"/>
   
   <updated>2012-04-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2012/04/17/block-apps-keyboard-maestro</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Previously, I shared how I &lt;a href=&quot;http://ryanirelan.com/articles/block-political-sites-with-hosts-file/&quot;&gt;block some political sites by editing my hosts file&lt;/a&gt; on OS X. About six months ago I also stopped reading RSS feeds, instead relying on a dozen bookmarks in Safari that I would read when I had time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to break the habit of opening &lt;a href=&quot;http://reederapp.com/&quot;&gt;Reeder&lt;/a&gt; every time I have a free moment, so I forced myself to not have access. Sure, I could have deleted the app entirely but instead I just used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/&quot;&gt;Keyboard Maestro&lt;/a&gt; to automatically quit the app every time I opened it and give me a reminder why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the macro I used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/keyboard_maestro_block_app.png&quot; alt=&quot;Keyboard Maestro macro to quit app&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trigger for the macro is when the Reeder application launches. After that the macro executes two actions: quit Reeder and then pop up an alert reminding me that I no longer read RSS feeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used this macro for about 6 months and I launched Reeder less and less. I recently went back to using Reeder for tracking Twitter searches and other feeds to help me find links and information to post to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://eeinsider.com&quot;&gt;EE Insider&lt;/a&gt; website. But I no longer launch Reeder out of habit like before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The silly season of politics seems to be year-round in the USA now so I’ve had to take some drastic measures to &lt;em&gt;force myself&lt;/em&gt; to break a couple of habits that aren’t healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Send Basecamp To-Dos to OmniFocus</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2012/03/22/send-basecamp-todos-to-omnifocus.html"/>
   
   <updated>2012-03-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2012/03/22/send-basecamp-todos-to-omnifocus</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On my &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.ryanirelan.com&quot;&gt;old site&lt;/a&gt; I posted an AppleScript that made it easy to move Basecamp to-dos from your email inbox right in to your OmniFocus inbox. The script was a hack of epic proportions (cobbled together with help from other scripts–credits in the source) but it worked. And, recently, people have been asking for it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here it is: &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.ryanirelan.com/BasecampToDosToOmniFocus.zip&quot;&gt;Basecamp To-dos to Omnifocus&lt;/a&gt; (zip)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.ryanirelan.com/blog/entry/automate-omnifocus-tasks-from-basecamp-to-dos/&quot;&gt;originally wrote&lt;/a&gt; when posting the script back in 2008:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m sure that I am one of many people who rely on both OmniFocus and Basecamp in their day-to-day work and task management. One of the things missing for me was a fairly automated way of getting To-dos out of Basecamp and into OmniFocus as tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.ryanirelan.com/blog/entry/automate-omnifocus-tasks-from-basecamp-to-dos/&quot;&gt;old instructions&lt;/a&gt; should still work and the script itself should work without any problems (that’s what I’ve been told). If you do have one, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/ryanirelan&quot;&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>New Mijingo Python Videos</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2012/03/14/new-mijingo-pythong-videos.html"/>
   
   <updated>2012-03-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2012/03/14/new-mijingo-pythong-videos</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the last week &lt;a href=&quot;http://mijingo.com&quot;&gt;Mijingo&lt;/a&gt; released two new screencasts. Both videos cover a topic new to the Mijingo catalog: Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting Python resources into the Mijingo catalog was party selfish. I wanted to learn Python and needed the resources to do so. Luckily, my pal &lt;a href=&quot;http://gregaker.net&quot;&gt;Greg Aker&lt;/a&gt; was not only good at Python but he was also willing (and most importantly &lt;em&gt;able&lt;/em&gt;) to record videos covering two topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mijingo.com/products/screencasts/python-for-php-developers/&quot;&gt;Python for PHP Developers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mijingo.com/products/screencasts/pip-and-virtualenv/&quot;&gt;PIP and Virtualenv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mijingo.com/products/screencasts/python-for-php-developers/&quot;&gt;Python for PHP Developers&lt;/a&gt; is a 54 minute video that covers all of the basics of Python for experienced PHP developers. In the video Greg covers topics like classes, strings, data structures, functions, lambdas and more. It’s a great overview of Python and should be your first stop in your journey to learn Python. It’s mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mijingo.com/products/screencasts/pip-and-virtualenv/&quot;&gt;PIP and Virtualenv&lt;/a&gt; is a shorter 17 minute video that is part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mijingo.com/blog/the-lunchwith-series&quot;&gt;Mijingo’s LunchWith Series&lt;/a&gt;. Int his video Greg Aker covers how you can improve your local Python development workflow using virtual environments with Virtualenv and PIP for simpler package managment. This is particulary handy if you’re new to Python and just want to mess around with different packages and setups without completely hosing your global Python installation. The video may only be 17 minutes but the information you learn from it will save you time and frustration every single day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These videos mark the beginning of my interest in Python and what Greg is planning to create and publish in partnership with Mijingo. Stay tuned for more.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The New Swipe</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2011/10/28/the-new-swipe.html"/>
   
   <updated>2011-10-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2011/10/28/the-new-swipe</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week, &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/10/26/applefication&quot;&gt;the daring John Gruber linked to&lt;/a&gt; a Dan Frommer piece called “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.splatf.com/2011/10/applefication/&quot;&gt;The Apple-fication of everything&lt;/a&gt;.” The write-up centered around the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nest.com/&quot;&gt;Nest thermostat&lt;/a&gt; and how the Steve Jobs legacy “taught hundreds of millions of consumers to expect and demand amazing things.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This expectation isn’t just with hardware design like the timeless iPhone 4(s) or iPad. &lt;em&gt;How&lt;/em&gt; we interact with our devices is equally as influenced by Apple products since the original iPhone. I’ve seen this happen several times (and have done it myself) with the Amazon Kindle, where someone tries to interact with the E-ink screen by touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a flight home from Washington, D.C. after the &lt;a href=&quot;http://aneventapart.com/&quot;&gt;An Event Apart&lt;/a&gt; conference, I noticed something funny about how a customer interacted with the DIRECTV screens in the seat backs of the Continental Airlines Boeing 737. Unlike on JetBlue flights, DIRECTV costs a fee to watch on Continental. The passenger is teased with a free preview of about 20 minutes in length. After that you are prompted to pay to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a photo of the screen but we were in the middle of some turbulence so the image is blurry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/swipe-now.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;DirectTV Swipe Now Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the screen reads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Looking for something fun to do? 
Watch live DIRECTV…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;along with some more text and then a prompt to “Swipe Now!” inside of a large arrow pointing to the right. The arrow was pointing to an old fashioned magnetic card reader where you swipe your credit card and pay for the DIRECTV access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since 2007, more than a hundred million people recognize the arrow to the right–and the prompt to swipe or slide–from the iPhone unlock screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of rows in front of me, I noticed an older man (about 60 years old) as he looked at the DIRECTV screen. When prompted to “Swipe Now!” he moved his hand toward the screen and quickly swiped left to right with his index finger. When nothing happened, he paused and looked at the screen. Confused, he moved on and flipped through the inflight magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Proper Halloween Candy Procurement Procedures</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2011/10/18/halloween-candy-memo.html"/>
   
   <updated>2011-10-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2011/10/18/halloween-candy-memo</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;TO: Team&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FROM: Management&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The procurement of Halloween candy during the month of October is an important process. Notice I did not say “the day before Halloween” or “five minutes before the first little brat rings the bell.” Properly sourced Halloween candy can take weeks. Start early and test often. That’s the motto. If you’re short on time, you can stop here. Otherwise, read on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;you-are-what-you-treat&quot;&gt;You Are What You Treat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you grab for that bag of mixed sweets, most of which you’ve never heard of because they were manufactured in the back woods of Bolivia by a pair of twin brother lumberjacks, please know that &lt;em&gt;you are what you treat&lt;/em&gt;. You should never, under any circumstances imaginable to the Almighty himself, hand out candy to the neighborhood goblins that you wouldn’t eat yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right. No off brand candy, no snack bites that barely fill the whole in your tooth and &lt;em&gt;absolutely no fresh fruit&lt;/em&gt;. I know you’d probably eat fresh fruit but handing out fruit instead of candy is creepy. The neighbors will forever walk suspiciously past your house while tightly grasping their child’s hand as if there was some evil vortex that could suck them into your yard and feed them fresh fruit for all of eternity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-proper-candy-qa&quot;&gt;Do Proper Candy QA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treat this like software. Do you write tests for your code? &lt;em&gt;Of course you do&lt;/em&gt;. Do you test everything three times before release? Yes. Do you spare no expense or time making sure it’s right? Oh yes you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do the same for your Halloween candy treats. All candy you procure must be thourougly taste tested. Typically, this responsibility falls to the man of the house, but anyone (except kids; too dangerous) will do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no limits to the testing. If I feel like eating…I mean if the testing warrants an extra bag of Peanut Butter Snickers(TM), then you should get that extra bag. This is no time to be selfishly concerned with the dolphin-like figure that you’ve been working on since your Spring allergies reminded you that pool season is around the corner. It’s October. Pool season isn’t even within a 5 mile radius. Plenty of time to shed the chunks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test and test often. Nauseua and diarrhea are signs of a true tester. BRB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-be-the-toothbrush-guy&quot;&gt;Don’t be the Toothbrush Guy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up there was a dentist in a neighborhood near mine who always gave out toothbrushes for Halloween. As kids, we all thought it was funny, odd, and kinda cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were dumb kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an adult I realized that dentist gave us toothbrushes &lt;em&gt;with his name on them&lt;/em&gt; and was simultaneously advertising his business to us while backhandedly telling us how dumb we were for inhaling pillow cases full of candy in 48 hours time. Yeah, well….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s brilliant, if you think about it. But don’t be the Toothbrush Guy. You’re not cute, funny or cool. You’re a tool handing out tools. The kids are there to rot their teeth for a few days per year. Back off with the holier than thou, Mr. Cavity Killer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go forth and do good work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cc: Toothbrush Guy, The World&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2011-08-27T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2011/08/27/5by5-x-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the last two weeks I had the privilege of sitting in for &lt;a href=&quot;http://danbenjamin.com&quot;&gt;Dan Benjamin&lt;/a&gt; as co-host of a handful of shows on his &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv&quot;&gt;5by5 network&lt;/a&gt; (Dan was out on paternity leave). It was a lot of fun but hard work, too. Dan certainly makes it look easy. There’s a lot happening before and during recording on top of carrying on conversations with his brilliant co-hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also happened to be filling in during a crazy week in the technology sector: &lt;a href=&quot;http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/google-to-buy-motorola-mobility/?scp=1&amp;amp;sq=google%20buys%20motorola&amp;amp;st=cse&quot;&gt;Google announced it will buy Motorola Mobility&lt;/a&gt;, HP said it’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/19/technology/hp-plans-big-shift-toward-business-customers.html?_r=1&amp;amp;scp=4&amp;amp;sq=HP&amp;amp;st=cse&quot;&gt;getting out of the PC business and shutting down the WebOS product line&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/25/technology/jobs-stepping-down-as-chief-of-apple.html?scp=10&amp;amp;sq=steve%20jobs&amp;amp;st=cse&quot;&gt;Steve Jobs resigned as CEO of Apple&lt;/a&gt;. The last shocker came after I recorded my final show but which &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/talkshow/56&quot;&gt;Dan jumped in to discuss with John Gruber on The Talk Show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breathe&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way, this surge of big news items made my job easier. There was plenty to talk about on the shows and the big news was right in my wheelhouse. I follow technology companies and regularly read all of the major news stories in that space. The big perk was I got to hop on the mic and talk about the news with some really smart people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a list of shows I did:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Build &amp;amp; Analyze&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/38&quot;&gt;Decaf Compatibility Stick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Build &amp;amp; Analyze&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/39&quot;&gt;TouchPad vs. TextMate vs. BBEdit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Critical Path&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/criticalpath/4&quot;&gt;Aquisitions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Critical Path&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/criticalpath/5&quot;&gt;HP’s Innovation Antibodies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hypercritical&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/30&quot;&gt;Paths in the Grass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hypercritical&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/31&quot;&gt;Strongs Arguments for and Against&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Talk Show&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/talkshow/55&quot;&gt;More Babies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan is back next week and I’m resuming my regular schedule of &lt;a href=&quot;http://happycog.com/&quot;&gt;cool stuff during the day&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=&quot;http://mijingo.com/&quot;&gt;creating helpful training materials at night&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the 5by5 listeners for the warm welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Navel Gazing</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2011/07/30/navel-gazing.html"/>
   
   <updated>2011-07-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2011/07/30/navel-gazing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Back in March I relaunched this website with a new, very minimal design and running on a new content management system. It didn’t seem necessary to announce anything since it’s just, you know, a blog. &lt;em&gt;My blog&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What started on Blogger and FTP’d to my university web account in 2001 while I was a graduate student at a &lt;a href=&quot;http://unc.edu&quot;&gt;fine university&lt;/a&gt;, has moved to several different platforms over the course of its nearly 10 year life online. At one point it was on Movable Type (who wasn’t?), WordPress, ExpressionEngine and now it’s just a bunch of static files sitting on a hard drive that you can see. &lt;em&gt;Hello&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Spring I moved the site to &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, which isn’t really a CMS at all. It’s a Ruby tool that generates a static website from a series of text files for entries and layout files. Every time I write a new entry (like this one) the site is completely regenerated. Movable Type did this, too, but Jekyll doesn’t have a GUI, isn’t a web application (you run it completely on your local machine), is free and surely won’t be sold to &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/21/video-egg-will-acquire-six-apart-and-rename-itself-say-media/&quot;&gt;some weird advertising company&lt;/a&gt;. Also, Jekyll generates my site from &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; files, which are just text files and will never fall victim to obsolete software. Sounds like a winner to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help me write quicker, I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/&quot;&gt;TextExpander&lt;/a&gt; loaded up with some snippets I made for my most commonly used Markdown. There are also snippets for creating the entry header (it contains the layout type, title and date) and the entry file name. If you don’t use TextExpander, give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick note about the design. It’s very basic, as you can see. The web font (I’m currently using Proxima Nova) is delivered using &lt;a href=&quot;http://typekit.com/&quot;&gt;TypeKit&lt;/a&gt; and the HTML5 and CSS are mine. Don’t laugh, okay? I followed the advice of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design&quot;&gt;Ethan’s book&lt;/a&gt; and made this site responsive. Go ahead and try it out. Looks nice on your phone or iPad, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For basketball season I included a “Game Day Mode.” You can toggle this on and off in the footer. Right now it’s just manual but perhaps I need a way to automatically turn it on for game days this coming Winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, I almost forgot. Why did I move away from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.expressionengine.com/index.php?affiliate=ryanirelan&quot;&gt;ExpressionEngine&lt;/a&gt;? Well, technically I am still running ExpressionEngine. The original site (before moving to Jekyll) was not moved over at all. I wanted to start fresh. But I did want to preserve my old blog, so I moved it all to &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.ryanirelan.com/&quot;&gt;archive.ryanirelan.com&lt;/a&gt;. All of the inbound links are redirected so I’m not party to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot&quot;&gt;breaking the internet&lt;/a&gt;. I switched from ExpressionEngine to Jekyll because I wanted to start keeping my writing in a format that I could take anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Grandma&#8217;s Feather Bed</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2011/07/25/grandmas-feather-bed.html"/>
   
   <updated>2011-07-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2011/07/25/grandmas-feather-bed</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In May of this year we sold our house and moved from Raleigh, NC to Austin, TX. The move was part of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://cognition.happycog.com/article/waterloo&quot;&gt;larger plan&lt;/a&gt; and also the fulfillment of our wish to become more flexible and free ourselves of home ownership for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of selling and moving is going through years of belongings and deciding what to keep, what to donate, recycle or send to the landfill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After living in the house for seven years, our attic was filled with boxes, old clothes, holiday decorations, backpacking gear, old rugs, records, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/ryanirelan/status/93528828625960960&quot;&gt;old files&lt;/a&gt; and more. Some of those boxes never saw the light of the sun since I taped them shut 7 years earlier. Inside many of the boxes were old items from my 20s and even my childhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was going through the items and had to make a “keep it or toss it” decision, I realized something surprising about myself: I am not at all emotionally or sentimentally attached to stuff. I keep stuff usually because I don’t want to make a decision to throw it away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It almost scared me how much I didn’t care about the stuff. High school yearbook? Don’t care (but I kept it anyway, see bullets below). Wooden wall clock I made myself in 8th grade? I was proud of it at the time but I don’t care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how did I decide what to toss? I tried to ask myself questions like these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does this item currently create happiness for me and my family?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Could this item create happiness for me and my family in the future?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is it something that my daughter would cherish when she’s older?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the stuff I came across in the attic, the answer was no. It’s all been tucked away in a dark, hot attic for years. None of that stuff creates or will ever create happiness. You don’t typically love the stuff you neglect. One of the exceptions were two boxes of 12 inch records. Those have brought happiness in the past and will continue to do so (once I set up my turntable).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking about this topic ever since watching the last box (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/sandw/5755675406/in/photostream&quot;&gt;and my car&lt;/a&gt;) loaded onto a moving truck. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/07/11/suburbs/&quot;&gt;this post from J. Eddie Smith&lt;/a&gt; reminded me again how much I just don’t care about the old stuff I don’t use. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.selfstorage.org/ssa/Content/NavigationMenu/AboutSSA/FactSheet/default.htm&quot;&gt;Self-storage is a 20 billion dollar per year industry&lt;/a&gt; and “has been the fastest growing segment of the commercial real estate industry over the last 30 years.” Americans spend 20 billion storing stuff we don’t use. Stuff we think we care about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect that a lot of this storage results from the tough situation of inheriting furniture and other goods that are &lt;em&gt;family heirlooms&lt;/em&gt;. That’s a nice way of saying “someone else’s junk just became yours.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Fall before our daughter was born we needed to empty some space to make room. I donated three pieces of furniture that were part of our family: my maternal grandfather’s rocking chair, my paternal grandfather’s desk he used in his cedar-paneled basement office (it was a roll-top desk that had the roll-top removed and was worthless, not to mention worn out) and a TV cabinet that I designed and built with my father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent any family issues, I cleared getting rid of the first two items with my parents. The third one, the TV cabinet I built with my dad in the woodworking shop in his garage in North Carolina, was tougher. While emptying it out, I found the initial sketch I made on a page from a pocket notebook for the piece taped inside the bottom cabinet. I made it as a gift for my wife for our first apartment in North Carolina. I was proud of it and it wasn’t a half bad piece of furniture. But I didn’t need to hold onto the TV cabinet–lugging it halfway across the country–to have the memory of building it with my dad and gifting it to my wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My take, however, isn’t universally accepted in our household.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What about the memories?” she asks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those memories are still in my head in exact details and I don’t need the wood, paint, casters and hinges to make the memory any more vivid than it already is. After all, we don’t expect to take home the entire beach after a memorable summer vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Absence of Failure</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2011/07/09/absence-of-failure.html"/>
   
   <updated>2011-07-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2011/07/09/absence-of-failure</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aworkinglibrary.com/library/book/managing_oneself/&quot;&gt;Mandy Brown’s recent note&lt;/a&gt; on the essay &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/142212312X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=ryanirelan-20&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Managing Oneself&lt;/em&gt; by Peter F. Drucker&lt;/a&gt; reminded me that I had the book sitting in my wishlist at Amazon. I put off purchasing it out of hope that it would be published as a Kindle book at some point. After seeing Mandy’s post I decided to just grab a paper copy (something I rarely do these days).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was certainly worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drucker touches on many topics throughout the book about managing your own career,  knowing yourself and your co-workers. He draws contrasts between the working life now and how it was before we had a vast majority of the workforce as knowledge workers. There are a few good suggestions on working in teams (the book would be a great team building exercise) and learning to work &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; your co-workers instead of just alongside them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But out of everything contained in the 55-page essay, what really stood out to me was his discussion of &lt;em&gt;success&lt;/em&gt;, which comes in the last few pages of the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a society in which success has become so terribly important, having options will become increasingly vital. Historically, there was no such thing as “success.” The overwhelming majority of people did not expect anything but to stay in their “proper stations,” as an old English prayer has it. The only mobility was downward mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a knowledge society, however, we expect everyone to be a success. This is clearly an impossibility. For a great many people, there is at best an absence of failure. Wherever there is success, there has to be failure. And then it is vitally important for the individual, and equally for the individual’s family, to have an area in which he or she can contribute, make a difference, and be &lt;em&gt;somebody&lt;/em&gt;. That means finding a second area–whether in a second career, a parallel career, or a social venture–that offers an opportunity for being a leader, for being respected, for being a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>iBook Reboxing</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In preparation for our move to Austin, I’ve been cleaning out the attic and found the box for my old iBook from 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iBook was my first Apple computer. I was in grad school when I bought it so it was a huge purchase for me at the time. It hasn’t been used in years and no longer turns on, so it was time to send it off to be recycled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/recycling/computer/&quot;&gt;computer recycling program&lt;/a&gt;. They send you a Fedex authorization and you can ship your computer back to them for free. If the computer can be reused you might even get a small gift card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I found the original packaging, I gave the iBook an unceremonious reboxing and documented the event with these photographs.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2011/04/14/the-original-hipstagram</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago I came across a framed photo of my father. It was sitting on the dresser in my parents bedroom. I took it out of the frame and scanned it into my laptop so I had a copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/sandw/3434756403/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3579/3434756403_57bb8694ca.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My Dad&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To people who know me or have met me this photo could easily be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://hipstamaticapp.com/&quot;&gt;Hipstamatic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://instagr.am/&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; shot of me from yesterday. And, oddly, until I saw this photo I never realized how much I look like my dad.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tu Etwas</title>
   
   <link href="http://ryanirelan.com/2011/04/05/tu-etwas.html"/>
   
   <updated>2011-04-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2011/04/05/tu-etwas</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While living in Germany from January 1998 to August 1999 I spent a large amount of my time practicing photography. I didn’t have a great camera (I arrived with the classic Pentax K-1000 and left with a marginally better Canon) and only decent composition skills I learned while studying video production at a performing arts high school. I wasn’t as good as I thought I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was 23 and still a kid. Sure, I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; made the big decision to sell my belongings and literally pack two bags and fly on a one-way ticket to Germany. But I was still young and, considering the opportunities in front of me, quite lazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother-in-law kindly arranged (through what I’m sure was a lot of persuading) an internship for me at the regional newspaper, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ln-online.de/&quot;&gt;Lübecker Nachricten&lt;/a&gt;. I spent some of my stay in Germany working as an intern (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/sandw/sets/237862/with/3274358/&quot; title=&quot;Small sampling of photos from Germany&quot;&gt;and got to photograph some fun stuff&lt;/a&gt;) and later landed a handful of easy freelance assignments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a slow few weeks in the Summer, I was loafing around the photography office and not doing much of anything but occupying space. I was called into photo editor’s office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hey Ami”, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ami” was his nickname for me; it’s a not mean, but not exactly endearing term for Americans, especially when &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=scheiss%20ami&quot;&gt;preceded by the word “Scheiß.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Tu etwas!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked around and it took a moment for it to register what he was saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This photo editor, who was the head of the photography department at the newspaper, is an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hourtifoto.de/galerie.php&quot;&gt;accomplished photographer&lt;/a&gt;. He traveled to more than one hundred countries doing photojournalism; he was in Afghanistan during the Soviet occupation in the 1980s, and was in the States photographing election campaigns of Ford, Carter and Reagan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time he brought out his heavy, oversized portfolio, I was stunned by the work and the locations he photographed. I admired his accomplishments, was inspired by his photography and always listened to his critiques of my work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I wasn’t doing anything with that inspiration and knowledge. I was sitting around the photo office with the other photographers instead of being out practicing my photography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the equivalent of loafing around the photography office is sitting hunched over your laptop, engrossed in your feedreader reading articles about creating stuff, admiring success stories and getting inspired. But none of that means anything at all unless you do something yourself or, as I was told:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Tu etwas!”&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What Didn&#8217;t Happen</title>

   <updated>2011-03-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2011/03/25/what-didnt-happen</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://northcarolina.rivals.com/content.asp?CID=1204149&quot;&gt;Exchange between a reporter and UNC basketball coach Roy Williams&lt;/a&gt; about two end-of-game situations involving sophmore John Henson:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coach, I’m curious, after the Washington game I’m curious what you said following some of the mental lapses in the final seconds. And also if you think it may help going forward in avoiding some similar situations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“You know, I don’t really know what mental lapse you are talking about. John Henson dropped the ball.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He could have let the ball go out of bounds in that situation and potential goaltending.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If the ball is being thrown to you, if you look at the play, he starts to try to catch it and it is going through his process, his brain as well. And some don’t make decisions in one half of a second. That didn’t bother me. I said, why didn’t you just catch the ball? And somebody else said, why don’t you just let it go? &lt;em&gt;There were three choices and hell, he chose the wrong one.&lt;/em&gt;” (emphasis mine)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“But he’s 18, 19—no, I think he just turned 20 recently. You have got to understand that part. But the mental lapse, he thought the ball would be completely short. If you look at it on tape, it could have easily, if a referee throughout of goaltending, they could say it had no chance to go in, which it didn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“But you also talk about mental lapses, he was also so sharp that he immediately, without the help of replay, said well, Coach, it was a two-pointer. I said, are you sure? He said, yeah, I saw where his feet were. So that is a guy that is thinking quite a bit. I said this before, you have a 20-year-old guy that acts like an 11-year-old and I love that part of him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one level you have a coach defending his player. Then you have a coach teaching a lesson about choices: sometimes they’re made quickly and sometimes you choose the wrong one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s about what &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; happen, not what could have.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s just part of it. The real problem is the increased public sharing of photos online. I don’t mean the photos I willingly share of my daughter on Twitter, Flickr or Facebook. I’m talking about the photos of people at public (or private) events plastered all over social networks without their permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I didn’t attend SXSW but instead observed it from the outside through Twitter, Flickr and Facebook. I was struck by how many personal moments were recorded and shared on social sites. How many of those people in the photos knew that was going to happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I’m stuck on a tough problem it doesn’t get solved staring at my computer screen. It gets solved sitting away from my desk and staring out the window or at the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The drive-by technorati are well-informed, curious and always probing. They’re also hiding… hiding from the real work of creating work that matters, connections with impact and art that lasts. I love to hear about the next big thing, but I’m far more interested in what you’re doing with the old big thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: look at how local businesses are marketing and innovating on some of the oldest trades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently had a company come clean and regrout our master bath shower. They weren’t a general flooring company that did new floors, contract with builders and other similar work; they only did restoration of existing tiled installations. Marketing themselves as an alternative to ripping out the tiles and starting over, their pitch was: “Pay us to save you money.” Their marketing is brilliantly focused on that idea.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cameron Moll &lt;a href=&quot;http://cameronmoll.tumblr.com/post/3031376012/for-non-startups-things-just-take-time&quot;&gt;posted his thoughts on “non-startups”&lt;/a&gt; (those without significant funding to quickly add resources) In &lt;a href=&quot;http://mijingo.com&quot;&gt;my own business&lt;/a&gt; I’ve regularly run into the problem of everything taking &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; longer than I’d like. I find solace in Cameron’s conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Accordingly, I’m growing convinced that, unless one works late nights and weekends like a Bay Area startup, it’s difficult for an independent team of two or three to move much faster than a corporate team of twenty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I already work many nights and weekends (because I also have a full-time position at Happy Cog) and still find it hard to move quickly on projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantage of being slower is that I think I can create better products and be more deliberate and thoughtful with my business moves. My customers and my goals drive the business, not a Series A round of funding burning a hole in my business account.&lt;/p&gt;
