   <title>Save Articles to DEVONthink Like Instapaper</title>

   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2016/11/28/save-articles-to-devonthink-like-instapaper</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite ways to save articles into DEVONthink is as OCR’d PDFs with simple formatting. That simple formatting? A la Instapaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instapaper has a very nice formatting style that makes web articles saved as PDFs readable and printable. I don’t save the article to read later, I save them to reference later. It’s important to me that they are self-contained (not links) and easy to read (not web archives).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve that I use the Chrome extension to capture a web page with DEVONthink. When capturing I use PDF (Paginated) as the format and check “Reformat with Instpaper.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mijingo.d.pr/iwAt/4JJxUhDU+&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In DEVONthink I get a paginted and OCR’d PDF with simple formatting. Any links are kept intact (but moved to parathenses) and at the bottom and top are links back to the source article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mijingo.d.pr/YeMv/3huXgYWM+&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main use case for this way of saving articles is when doing reesarch and planning for a new course. I’ll save articles I find and then store them in DEVONthink for later reference. I’ve tried several ways to saving web articles in DEVONthink and this is the best I’ve found.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Minimalism Wallet</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the last year I’ve been using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2gazHa1&quot;&gt;Infinity Wallet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as my every day wallet. I’m not a regular cash carrier so I use this wallet almost exclusviely for cards. It will stretch to fit as many cards as you need and then snap back when you downsize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Infinity Wallet has two slots on each side to hold cards and a middle area (that is open on both ends) to easily slide in cash. The tension from the wallet and cards keeps whatever is in the middle space secure. I like to use this middle space for temoporary items, like parking tickets or hotel room key cards.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Every venture-funded company has to cross the chasm to profitability, and we decided the time was now,” Carson wrote in an email to EdSurge. After today’s layoff, he expects the company to be “very close to profitable [as year-over-year] revenue growth for the last six years has been climbing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have to use terms like “crossing the chasm to profitability” things are most likely not good.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>More on Constants While Indie</title>

   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2016/08/15/more-on-constants-while-indie</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago I linked to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.manton.org/2016/08/1-year-indie.html&quot;&gt;Manton’s post about his first year indie&lt;/a&gt; and I noted that establishing as many constants as possible helps ease stress. The example I gave was establishing a payroll to pay myself. Of course, I still have to generate the revenue to support the payroll but you’d be surprised how much simpler that is if you know that payroll will hit on a certain day. There’s no “maybe” or “I’ll pay myself late”; you have to hit your mark every month (I pay myself monthly). That’ll keep things lined up and running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The "Netflix for Education" Vision</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But despite the compelling nature of this “Netflix of Education” vision, it can encourage a misleading view of personalized learning. Examining several key areas where the educational Netflix analogy breaks down can help us better understand the qualities of an effective personalized learning solution. Failure to appreciate these points will result in personalized learning products more likely to hinder than help students.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;L. humile isn’t your stereotypical ant, with one queen and many workers laboring in a single nest. Argentine ants have multiple queens per colony, and there can be as many as 300 queens for every 1,000 workers. This makes them virtually impossible to kill with poison bait traps, which work on the principle that workers bring the tasty toxins back to the queen, whose death destroys the colony. When you have a lot of queens, that’s not an effective strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Proper Index Cards</title>

   <id>http://ryanirelan.com/2016/08/12/proper-index-cards</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure what happened with index cards. Most of the cards you can buy now are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; cut from card stock but instead a heavyweight paper stock.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:notapaperexpert&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:notapaperexpert&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do not want those. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.staples.com/Oxford-3-inch-x-5-inch-Heavy-Weight-Lined-Ruled-White-Index-Cards-100/product_71737&quot;&gt;You want these. Oxford 3x5 Heavy weight index card &lt;/a&gt; (I’ll leave lined or unlined up to you–I prefer lined).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My local office supply didn’t have them the last time I ordered, so I used Amazon. I just looked and even Amazon isn’t carrying them (third party sellers were but I don’t use them because they’re price gougers). You might want to stock up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative is the excellent looking &lt;a href=&quot;http://nockco.com/paper/dotdash-3-x-5-note-cards&quot;&gt;DotDash notecard by Nock Co.&lt;/a&gt; They are quite a bit more expensive but you will get quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My video on how I create courses for &lt;a href=&quot;https://mijingo.com&quot;&gt;Mijingo&lt;/a&gt; explains how I use notecards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/34iWYR1U6aE?list=PLCy7dPypkr2pO78F3p3Go8daNLLCd7CfF&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:notapaperexpert&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I’m not a paper expert so if I’m confusing the terms “card stock” and “heavy weight paper” please correct me. Let’s just one is too thin and the other is a proper index card, deal? &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:notapaperexpert&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But I also have to admit that when you’re the father of two daughters, you become even more aware of how gender stereotypes pervade our society. You see the subtle and not-so-subtle social cues transmitted through culture. You feel the enormous pressure girls are under to look and behave and even think a certain way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sums up my biggest challenge as the father of a daugther.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Manton Reece on 1 Year Indie</title>
   
   <link href="http://www.manton.org/2016/08/1-year-indie.html"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And I made a few decisions early on with how to manage the business that have proven useful to smooth over the bumps. For example, I pay myself a fixed salary on the 1st day of each month, and for 12 months straight I’ve always met that goal. This month, I gave myself a small raise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key to staying sane while on the indie bootstrapping path is to create as many constants as possible. For me, setting up automatic payroll has been one of those constants that reduces worry. It’s like automatically paying your monthlty bills; you have to do it, so make it automatic and then focus on other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
