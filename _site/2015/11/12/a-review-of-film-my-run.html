        <h1>A Review of the film My Run</h1>
      
      <p class="published-on"><time pubdate datetime="11-12-2015">November 12, 2015</time></p>  
      <p>Since I started running 9 months ago I’ve been curious about others’ running experiences, especially people on the edges: those who are elite and pushing the boundaries in distance and speed, and those who are new to running and doing something amazing.</p>

<p>That drew me to the story of Terry Hitchcock: a widower who lost his wife to cancer, and single father raising three kids. You probably heard his story back in the early 90s.</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Fox">Terry Fox</a>, who ran one-legged across Canada while fighting cancer to raise awareness for cancer research, Terry Hitchcock decided to run across several US states to raise awareness of the challenges facing single parents. A worthy cause for sure.</p>

<p>The documentary <em>My Run</em> is about Terry Hitchcock’s journey running 75 marathons in 75 days going from Minnesota to Atlanta (just in time for the Olympic Games).</p>

<p>This amazing story and motivation by Terry has the makings of wonderful documentary. After all, it did win festival awards, including at its debut right here in Austin.</p>

<p>But the film didn’t do Terry’s wonderful story justice. It sold it short through choppy storytelling. There was no real arc to the story, no build up, just a mundane recounting of the timeline of Terry’s epic run.</p>

<p>As Terry progressed through his 75 days journey, the film was a headwind, holding back any sense of progress, drama, and excitement.</p>

<p>It seems like a such an easy story to tell (to a non-filmmaker like me).</p>

<p>Despite the experience of the film itself (in this case the medium is most definitely <em>not</em> the message), I still recommend that you rent, stream, or buy the film and watch it.</p>

<p>Get beyond the film treatment of the Terry’s story and admire, wince, and worry about someone’s determination to finish a near impossible feat.</p>

<p>I picked up a copy at my local library and that might be your best best, too, for finding the movie.</p>
